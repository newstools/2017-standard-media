NAIROBI, KENYA: Kenyans will from midnight pay more for fuel products as Energy Regulatory Commission adjusts prices for a one month period to March 14. Price of petrol has been increased by Sh4.26 per litre and diesel by Sh5.03 while Kerosene goes up by Sh3.75 per litre. &ldquo;The changes in this month&rsquo;s prices have been as a consequence of the average landed cost of imported super petrol increasing by 8.45 per cent from $530.24 per ton in December last year to $575.06 in January this year,&rdquo; said the regulator in a statement. The adjustment is likely to impact on various households who depend on transport to work and transport food stuff to far areas like the urban centers from the farms.
