The Teachers Service Commission (TSC) is yet to release payments due to the family of Salah Farah - the Muslim teacher killed as he shielded Christians from the Al Shabaab. During the attack on a bus heading to Mandera in December 2015, Mr Farah together with other Muslims refused to be separated from Christian passengers by the militants. The terrorists planned to kill the Christian passengers. Farah sustained gunshot injuries and was admitted to a local hospital and later transferred to Kenyatta National Hospital where he succumbed to his injuries on January 19, 2016. President Uhuru Kenyatta posthumously awarded him with a heroic award of Grand Warrior of Kenya. Farah left behind a widow, Dunia Mohamed Ahmed, and five children. But although TSC last year gave the widow a Sh500,000 cheque to educate her eldest daughter who was by then in Standard Three, no other payments have been made to her. ALSO READ: Forget it! No more relaxed holidays, TSC insists Thanking the TSC for the school fees cheque, the family spokesperson, Ibrahim Farah, who is also a teacher, said payment of benefits due to the heroic teacher was long overdue, and called for the teacher&#39;s employer to expedite the process. Area TSC Director Jimale Ahmed also hailed TSC for moving to secure Farah&#39;s daughter&#39;s education.
