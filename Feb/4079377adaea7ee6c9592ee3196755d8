A US diplomat was Sunday arrested after brandishing a gun at a civilian following an accident in Nairobi. The diplomat was driving a four-wheel drive car bearing US embassy registration numbers when he was involved in a non-injury accident along Lusaka Road. When the motorist involved in the accident tried to seek explanation from him, he allegedly brandished a gun before he drove off. The vehicle registration numbers 29CD701K was circulated in the police communication channel before he was stopped along University Way by traffic personnel. &nbsp;&ldquo;We are talking to a foreigner involved in a traffic incident and there are other claims against him but no injury was reported,&rdquo; said Central OCPD Robinson Thuku.
