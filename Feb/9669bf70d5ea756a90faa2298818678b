An aspirant for the Nairobi governor&#39;s seat, Peter Kenneth, has hit out at Governor Evans Kidero and accused him of peddling rumours about his candidacy. Mr Kenneth said the governor had been spreading the rumour that his (Kenneth&#39;s) campaign was being sponsored by &quot;outsiders&quot;. &quot;I do not need people from another region to run my campaign in Nairobi. This is where I was born. Talk that I belong elsewhere is propaganda being propagated by Governor Kidero,&quot; he said. He blamed Dr Kidero for presiding over poor delivery of services in Nairobi during his term. &quot;The current office should prove that it can do something in the remaining four months before the end of their term. Let us discuss the issues that affect ordinary citizens,&quot; he said. Since declaring his intention to run for the governor&#39;s seat, the former Gatanga MP has been forced to fend off claims from his competitors that he is being imposed on the people of Nairobi by outsiders.

Kenneth will fight for a Jubilee Party ticket against Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, Nominated MP Johnson Sakaja, Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru and former Starehe MP Margaret Wanjiru. Last week, Kenneth faced off with the governor at a church service during which Kidero poked fun at him for abandoning his presidential ambitions in favour of the governorship.
