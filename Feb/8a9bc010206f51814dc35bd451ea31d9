Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i has vowed to protect schools from land-grabbers. Dr Matiangi said his ministry will extend support to church-sponsored schools in their battle to ward off land-grabbers. The CS&#39;s remarks comes amid several court cases in the area touching on grabbed school land. Speaking&nbsp;during a Sunday mass at Kisii town parish, the CS said school land that lacked title deeds was easy targets for land grabbers. &quot;We will protect such land from grabbers. Political leaders and all other stakeholders should protect school. The Government will deal with those who think they are untouchables,&quot; said Matiangi. Dr Matiang&#39;i explained that his ministry was working closely with the Ministry of Lands to ensure that issuance of title deeds to schools is fast-tracked.

We need to be part of those offering solutions and not escalating the problem,&quot; he said. Matiang&#39;i said his ministry will continue strengthening the education sector by carrying out reforms based on consultation and aimed at restoring integrity. &quot;For a long time the credibility of the education sector had been compromised. We will listen to all manner of criticism but not to those who want to take us back. Education matters should never be politicised,&quot; he added. The CS, who was accompanied by Kitutu Chache North MP Jimmy Angwenyi, rallied residents to register as voters. &quot;This region has over 2 million voters, enough to determine the country&#39;s political direction,&quot; he said.
