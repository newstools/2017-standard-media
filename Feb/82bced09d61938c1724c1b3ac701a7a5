Airtel Kenya has extended its support for digital literacy in peri-urban and urban communities across Kenya. The mobile service provider will now provide more routers and 3G connectivity to ensure free Internet connection services to the Intel Mobile Caravan under the She Will Connect programme. Following the official launch of the Intel Mobile Caravan in September last year by Airtel, Intel and other partners, a three-day training for trainers was organised earlier this month to equip the trainers for the new content, platform and schedules that will be adopted in the next phase of the campaign. The pilot phase programme has impacted the lives of 3,200 beneficiaries in four counties; Narok, Nairobi, Murang&#39;a and Machakos where the caravan toured. The caravan targets women, teachers as well as students and provides free ICT training. The next phase of the campaign will target eight counties including Uasin Gishu, Trans Nzoia, Kakamega and Narok.
