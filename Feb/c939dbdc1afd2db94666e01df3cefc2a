Jubilee will support embattled Kwale governor Salim Mvurya in his battle with the Opposition, Deputy President William Ruto has said. The DP said Mvurya had found himself at the centre of an onslaught by the Opposition since he defected from the Orange Democratic Movement and declared his support for Jubilee. Mr Ruto noted that the libel suit filed by Mombasa governor Hassan Ali Joho on the grounds that he had been defamed by Mvurya was driven by a desire to punish the Kwale County boss. On Friday Joho threatened to sue Mvurya and his deputy Fatuma Achani accusing them of defaming him. But yesterday Ruto, who was touring Kwale with Mvurya, declared that the ruling coalition would&nbsp; stand by Mvurya and protect him from the Opposition. &ldquo;Mvurya has been sued because he defended the rights of people of Kwale and its resources including minerals. As a government we are behind him and let him stand firm...will make sure that the right of the Kwale people are protected,&rdquo; said Ruto.
