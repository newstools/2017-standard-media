SIAYA, KENYA: Siaya County leaders&nbsp;reacted&nbsp;angrily to claims by an American investor, Mr Calvin Burges, that they have been harassing and extorting money from him. Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo, his Bondo counterpart Gideon Ochanda and Kisumu deputy Governor&nbsp; Ruth Odinga accused&nbsp; Mr&nbsp; Burges of looking for an excuse to abandon the Dominion farms project at Yalla&nbsp; swamp which they said&nbsp;was collapsing due&nbsp;to mismanagement and nonpayment of staff. The leaders defended ODM leader Raila Odinga against accusations by Mr Burges that he tried&nbsp;to force the investor, who owns&nbsp;rice and fish farms at the Yalla Swamp,&nbsp;to fund&nbsp;his&nbsp;Presidential campaigns&nbsp;in 2007. Jakoyo asked&nbsp;why Mr&nbsp;Burges&nbsp;declined&nbsp;to appear before the Parliamentary Committee&nbsp;on Agriculture&nbsp;which had&nbsp;summoned&nbsp;him if he was sincere in his claims. Mr&nbsp;Burges&nbsp;has been having problems&nbsp;with local leaders and&nbsp;residents over his alleged failure to implement promises&nbsp;he gave to the locals in 2003.

In fact I suspected he was not&nbsp;sincere from the first day he set foot&nbsp;in Siaya.&nbsp; He is now throwing tantrums because his tricks and wayward ways&nbsp;of doing business have been discovered,&quot; said Midiwo who was among those mentioned&nbsp;adversely by Mr&nbsp;Burges. The leaders argued that the investor was planning to run away because he had failed&nbsp;to honor&nbsp; the MOU he had signed&nbsp; with the&nbsp; now defunct Siaya, Bondo and&nbsp; County Councils that he would provide, water, build&nbsp; schools, hospitals&nbsp; and roads in the project area. They said&nbsp;that it was because of the Dominion Farms&nbsp;activities&nbsp;at the Swamp that the Lake&nbsp;Kanyaboli was drying up. Midiwo further claimed that the Dominion investor had created the same issues when he&nbsp;was running&nbsp;farming projects&nbsp;in Ghana before running away to Kenya.
