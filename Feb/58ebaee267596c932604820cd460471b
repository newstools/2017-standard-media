The Coalition for Reform and Democracy (CORD) co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka has denied reports that he plans to go it alone in August General Election. The Wiper Party leader, who is in his third day of political rallies in the large Gusii region, said every party is competing for space within the National Supper Alliance (NASA)&nbsp;. He called on other NASA leaders to remain focused in their objective to send home Jubilee administration. Addressing the media in Kisii Tuesday morning, Kalonzo said&nbsp;nothing will stop him from going for&nbsp;the top seat. Kalonzo said that during the Wiper party delegates&rsquo; conference, he was endorsed for the presidential seat and that nothing has changed since then. &quot;It is my right to go for the presidential seat through NASA. Some agents who are not comfortable with the new alliance are agents of our competitors,&quot; he said.

We are not in the campaigns but mobilising people to register in numbers,&quot; he said. Kalonzo said&nbsp;that he has been in constant touch with former Premier Raila Odinga all through the two days he has been in Kisii.
