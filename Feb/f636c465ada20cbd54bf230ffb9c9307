Imposing an external &quot;trusteeship&quot; government on South Sudan to try to end a three-year ethnic civil war and potential genocide in the world&#39;s youngest nation would only make its security situation worse, Uganda said on Thursday. Patience towards President Salva Kiir&#39;s government in Juba has worn thin as the refugee numbers have grown, fuelling talk in international policy circles &ndash; including the opinion pages of the New York Times - that &quot;trusteeship&quot; is a viable solution. However, Ugandan Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Okello Oryem rejected the notion, saying such interference would be opposed even by Kiir&#39;s sworn enemy, Riek Machar, currently under house arrest in South Africa. &quot;I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea,&quot; said Oryem, the principal foreign policy voice in Uganda, one of South Sudan&#39;s most powerful neighbors. &quot;That&#39;s a colonial mentality. If an attempt was made to have trusteeship in South Sudan, then I think even the Machar side would resist it and fight it,&quot; he told Reuters in an interview. &quot;That&#39;s an idea that should not be mooted.&quot; South Sudan gained its independence from Sudan in 2011 but tensions between its many different ethnic groups quickly surfaced and civil war broke out in 2013 between Kiir&#39;s largely Dinka security forces and units loyal to Machar, a Nuer.

Uganda sent in troops when hostilities first broke out in 2013, a move that Kampala says prevented ethnic slaughter on a similar scale to the 1994 Rwandan genocide. However, criticism of its action and suggestions it had ulterior motives meant Uganda was not prepared to re-commit any troops, even under the aegis of a Regional Protection Force mooted last year by the African Union, Oryem said. &quot;We were misunderstood by the international community and all hell broke out - we were being accused of everything under the sun and being told to leave,&quot; he said. &quot;We&#39;ve told them we are not going to go back,&quot; he added. &quot;Uganda has no more interest in sending its troops and boys to South Sudan.&quot; Separately, army spokesman Richard Karemire said the overall security situation in South Sudan had improved since Machar&#39;s flight from Juba. He also voiced support for the removal of Machar, once Kiir&#39;s deputy, from circulation by South Africa late last year. &quot;Would South Sudan sleep in the absence of Riek Machar?&quot; Karemire said. &quot;Every time there is a problem, he is in the middle of it. This is something we&#39;ve got to ask ourselves.&quot; ALSO READ: UN wants Kenyan troops to take up Darfur peacekeeping in bid to mend relations
