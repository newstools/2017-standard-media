The Kenya National Union of Teachers said it would mobilise its 200,000 members to vote against Jubilee. Led by Secretary General Wilson Sossion, the officials have accused the Jubilee government of refusing to address concerns raised by the union over the years. &#39;&#39;We have been for years asking the Government to hire at least 100,000 teachers yet the best it can allocate is 5,000 slots each financial year. It also appears reluctant to implement reforms in the education sector,&#39;&#39; Sossion added. Speaking in Kisumu when he unveiled a Sh39 million teachers&#39; benevolence project and building, Sossion&nbsp; dismissed guidelines issues by Teachers Service Commission boss, Nancy Macharia asking teachers to attend school over the weekend and during holidays when the need arises. He said: &#39;&#39;You cannot make such a unilateral decision which infringe of the fundamental freedom of the teachers without consulting Knut,&#39;&#39; said Sossion. Knut&#39;s Mumias Executive Branch Secretary John Wesonga,&nbsp; Kisumu Branch Chairman Edward Olando and Deputy Secretary General Hesbon Otieno urged teachers ignore circulars asking them to work over the weekends, saying it was irregular.
