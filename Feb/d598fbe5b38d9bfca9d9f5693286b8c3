The identification of bidders to supply kits for the August 8 elections has reached a critical stage. Yesterday, the Independent Electoral and Boundary Commission CEO Ezra Chiloba said the exercise is ongoing and due diligence will be followed to ensure it is above board. The commission opened the bids last Tuesday after the February 2 deadline for submission was closed. The electoral body has less than a month to complete the evaluation exercise and award the tender to the successful bidder. At the same time, IEBC must put extra effort to beat the May 10, deadline when the kits are required to be used in verification of voters. If the procurement fails, then the entire elections project will be in jeopardy, as the technology is requisite component of the election after the passing of Election Amendment Laws.
