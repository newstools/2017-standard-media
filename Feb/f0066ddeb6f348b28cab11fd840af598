Residents of Lunga Lunga Constituency have accused a politician of hoodwinking them to transfer their votes. The politician from Vanga is said to have transported voters from neighbouring wards to Vanga to influence the forthcoming elections. Residents who spoke to The Standard said they were ferried in buses and told they were attending a campaign rally at Lunga Lunga boarder. &ldquo;Thursday the bus came around 11am. I was given Sh300 to change my voting area. I wanted to refuse but how could I go home considering that transport is more than Sh400,&rdquo; posed Henry Rai. He was among the 180 people that had been ferried.
