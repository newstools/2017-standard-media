The Government has drafted a Bill that seeks to control the multi-billion-shilling betting industry. The Gaming Bill, 2016, has radical proposals that will affect sport betting lottery firms and casino owners, if MPs pass it into law. Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery on Thursday presented the Bill drafted by the Betting Control and Licensing Board before the parliamentary departmental committee on Labour and Social Welfare. Among a raft of other proposals, the Bill recommends steep fines to be imposed on industry players who allow under-age persons to participate in gambling and other related activities. &quot;A person who bets with a young person commits an offence and shall upon conviction be liable to a fine not exceeding Sh500,000 or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or both,&quot; reads the Bill in part. A similar punishment will be handed people selling lottery tickets to those under 18 years.
