Machakos gubernatorial aspirant Wavinya Ndeti has said she will neither fold her political party, Chama Cha Uzalendo (CCU), nor bow to pressure to become anyone&#39;s running mate in the coming elections. Speaking at the weekend during her voter sensitisation tour across different towns, the former Kathiani MP declared her name will be on the ballot and told off politicians who have been urging her to fold her party and join Wiper. &quot;It must be known that Machakos belongs to all of us and residents have the right to elect a leader of their choice regardless of which party they contest on,&quot; she said.
