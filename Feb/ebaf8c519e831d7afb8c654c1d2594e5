More than 247 ODM women leaders have embarked on mobilising residents to register as voters. The women aim to reach at least half of the number targeted by the time the registration deadline elapses. The county is currently lagging behind the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission target. The women led by ODM deputy organising secretary Rosa Buyu vowed to go to their villages to speak with residents in order to increase the number of those registering. &quot;Currently, those who have registered are less than 50 per cent of the electoral body&#39;s target. This is why we have decided to go door-to-door,&quot; Buyu said. The campaign is dubbed &#39;Last Lap by Women.&#39;
