&nbsp; FiveSok, an online platforms aimed at helping Kenyans find part-time jobs, is set to launch in the market tomorrow. The platform connects potential clients to small-scale service providers, including tutors, graphic designers and online marketers. Unlike other classified platforms, FiveSok only compiles the services ranging from Sh500 to Sh5,000. Upon successful completion of the work, users can earn positive rankings which leads to more visibility and sales. The firm was first piloted in the market in June last year by a team of entrepreneurs looking to help combat the country&rsquo;s youth unemployment rate. The platform will be launching an upgraded version based on the feedback of 5,000 users tomorrow. &nbsp;Emmanuel Soroba, the platform&rsquo;s founder and CEO, said: &ldquo;By enabling people to request services, FiveSok can compile and present skilled Kenyans with a comprehensive list of people looking for their services.&rdquo;
