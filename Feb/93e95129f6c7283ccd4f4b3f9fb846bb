President Uhuru Kenyatta has announced a rapid expansion plan for technical colleges. The President said 70 new colleges that are in different stages of completion, once commissioned, would accommodate 100,000 more students. He said the Government&#39;s plan is to have at least 50,000 learners in Technical Vocational Education and Training (TVET) institutions in the next five years. This year, the President said, the Government has allocated Sh500 million in tuition fees for students joining the technical colleges. At least 400,000 students who sat the Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) exams in 2016 but did not score the C+ university entry grade are expected to join the technical colleges. &quot;An additional 70 TVET institutions will enable us close the critical skills gap. It cannot be that we have too few artisans and technicians compared to engineers,&quot; said the President.
