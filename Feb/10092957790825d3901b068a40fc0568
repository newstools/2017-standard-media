Mombasa,Kenya: The bodies of three soldiers killed in a terrorist raid on Kenya Defence Forces KDF camp at Kulbiyow in Southern Somalia were brought to a private mortuary in Mombasa under a cloak of secrecy. The corpses arrived at Moi International Airport in a military transport plane at around 7.00am and were transferred to Pandya Memorial Hospital Mortuary in private hearses. The military officers who accompanied the corpses did not wear uniform, apparently, to conceal the arrival of the bodies. And there areas surrounding and inside the hospital were swarming with men and women believed to be from the Military Intelligence.
