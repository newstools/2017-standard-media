The announcement by Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos that he will retire after 38 years should be greeted with tempered relief. The strongman has been at the helm for far too long and the country will need fresh blood to steer it up a new course following the collapse of the economy last year. Only five years ago, Angola was one of the fastest growing economies in the world &mdash; it re-wrote history books when it pumped billions of dollars into the economy of its former colonial master, Portugal, at the height of the financial crisis. However, fortunes changed with the collapse of oil prices in 2013 and the country has barely had enough money to pay salaries. Indeed, Angola is relying on Chinese patronage to stay afloat. Against this backdrop, it follows that quitting was the only sensible option available to the strongman. Many African leaders have clung on to power even when it is clear that they have become liabilities to their countries. This has in the past triggered violent protests and coups to force unpopular regimes out of power. Only this year, Gambia&rsquo;s former President Yahya Jammeh had to be ejected from office after he refused to cede power to Adama Barrow after losing the presidential elections. However, a crisis was averted when the regional bloc, Ecowas, intervened and forced Jammeh into exile. It is our hope that Dos Santos will keep his word and step down when his term ends. This will give Angola another opportunity to regenerate.
