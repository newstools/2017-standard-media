Deputy President William Ruto and Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka yesterday held separate rallies in Narok County where they urged residents to register as voters. Ruto who spoke at Nairegia-Enkare in Narok East asked locals to ensure the right leaders are elected by taking the voter&#39;s cards and participating in the electoral process. &quot;Register and support the Government. By so doing, you will get good roads, health and education facilities. In Narok alone, we have 100,000 people without voters&#39; cards. Those people are in your midst, they are your friends, brothers, neighbours. Encourage them to get listed,&quot; said DP. He added: &quot;As for the ladies, don&#39;t date a man who does not have a voter&#39;s card because such a man may be lacking something else. They may turn out to be irresponsible fathers.&quot; Ruto who was accompanied by area Governor Samuel Tunai dismissed the Opposition, saying they have no agenda for the country. He said opposition leaders are disorganised based on the fact they are yet to name their flag bearer.

Hata hawajui chama ni gani wala presidential candidate wao ni nani (our friends are a confused lot, they are yet to know what their party will and who their flag bearer will also be),&quot; said Ruto. And Kalonzo, who spoke at Ntulele in Narok East, blamed runaway corruption in the Jubilee administration for Foreign Affairs CS Amina Mohamed&#39;s failure to clinch the AU Commission post in Monday&#39;s elections in Addis Ababa. &quot;It is the bad name Jubilee has made for itself through mega scandals that made even the East African countries fail to support Amina,&quot; he said. He added: &quot;Amina Mohammed is a brilliant lady and I have faith in her. She was defeated, not because she is not fit for the job but because of Jubilee&#39;s bad reputation,&quot; said Kalonzo. &quot;It is unfortunate the Government wasted hundreds of millions campaigning for the CS, money that could have been used to save the many Kenyans who have been affected by drought.&quot; He urged locals to register and vote Jubilee out in the coming elections. &quot;It now clear even our neighbours Uganda, Burundi and Rwanda have no faith in Kenya because of this government.&quot; ALSO READ: Turkana leaders criticise Ruto's visit, accuse him of forcing leaders on locals
