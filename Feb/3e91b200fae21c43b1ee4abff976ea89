A group of motorists using roads near Wilson Airport have launched an online petition to stop being charged every time they drive there. They are opposed to a toll station that was placed outside the airport that now affects all premises including banks, restaurants, warehouses and other entities that operate near the airport. The petitioners want Kenya Airports Authority to stop charging them parking fees if and when they don&rsquo;t drive into the airport. They claim they are charged flat fee of Sh250 whenever one drives into the larger compound and not necessarily the airport. &ldquo;Why should I pay Sh250 when I am not driving into the airport? I run a business entity near here and I wonder why they moved the toll station to this place,&rdquo; said one of the petitioners. Other petitioners claimed the money is being pocketed by a top politician. Kenya Airports Authority said the road was built and maintained by the authority. &ldquo;With regard to the issue raised online alleging land grabbing at Wilson Airport; we would like to clarify that the road in question is within Kenya Airports Authority land. The road was built by KAA and is maintained by the Authority,&rdquo; said a statement from KAA. The statement said KAA can&rsquo;t comment further on the matter, as issues around it are pending hearing and determination by the court.
