KISUMU, KENYA: An&nbsp;Israeli&nbsp;Company is seeking permission from&nbsp;the Kisumu County government to establish a dairy farm in a move meant&nbsp;to boost milk production and lower commodity costs for residents. The county has opened talks with Alefbet Planners&#39; Livestock and Farm department to build loose barns for 10, 000 dairy cows and set up a feed manufacturing arm. Last week another Israeli company- Raanan-announced&nbsp;it was putting up a fish and animal feed&nbsp;company in the lakeside&nbsp;town. AlefBet officials said on Tuesday that&nbsp;they will provide comprehensive solutions for the dairy farmers, with tailored solutions to meet various climate, agricultural and geographic conditions. Muhoroni sub-county, which borders dairy farming Kericho and Nandi counties, has been identified as a potential location for the farm.
