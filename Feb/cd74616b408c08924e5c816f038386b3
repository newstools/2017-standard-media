Safaricom has partnered with the Kenya Alliance of Resident Associations (KARA) to beef up security in neighbourhoods, in its efforts to promote sustainable cities and communities. Under the partnership, Safaricom will cooperate with residents&#39; associations in laying out and maintaining telecommunication infrastructure for use in deploying technology to enhance security. Speaking during the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by the two organisations, Safaricom CEO Bob Collymore noted that it provides a framework for cooperation in leveraging technology to address challenges in the neighbourhoods. &ldquo;This partnership opens the door in co-creating solutions that will promote sustainable development in our neighbourhoods. This is in line with our agenda to transform lives of Kenyans,&rdquo; Mr Collymore added. KARA is an umbrella organisation made up of over 1,000 residents&#39; associations from across the country. The CEO of KARA, Henry Ochieng, said that the deal with Safaricom is a boost to the organisation&rsquo;s efforts to ensure living space that permits a life of dignity for all as enshrined in the organisation&rsquo;s vision.
