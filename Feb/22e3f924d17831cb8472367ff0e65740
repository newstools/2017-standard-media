Nairobi Securities Exchange (NSE) will for the first time involve non-students in its annual NSE Investment Challenge. Speaking during the launch of the competition&rsquo;s 2017 edition yesterday, NSE Chief Executive Geoffrey Odundo said involving the wider public would increase enlightment on the benefits of trading in stocks. He said this year&rsquo;s challenge is in line with the market regulator&rsquo;s agenda of public education. &ldquo;We need to understand how to invest in the market and how to make wealth. For the past 10 years we have been running it (the challenge), we&rsquo;ve been targeting tertiary institutions, but this is the time to make it an open programme,&rdquo; said Mr Odundo. He also urged Kenyans to invest in the stock market, saying it is a good time due to increased turnover at the bourse. &ldquo;We are in a cycle that has great opportunity and the turnover is encouraging at this time.&rdquo;
