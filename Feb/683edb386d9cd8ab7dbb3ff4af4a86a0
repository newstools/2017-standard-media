Detectives from the Ethnic and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) have arrested 26 Members of County Assembly in Trans-Nzoia County over claims of abuse of office. The Speaker David Sifuna and Clerk Ainea Indakwa and some MCAs are at large and are being pursued by the officers. Some of the MCAs were seized from their hide outs in Kitale town after dodging the detectives since last Friday. The EACC detectives are targeting 41 council officials wanted for allegedly taking sh 47,000 as imprest to facilitate their trip to Nairobi to receive the body of their colleague Ronald Matongolo in 2014. Investigations over the imprest taken by the MCAs were prompted after it emerged that the body they were supposedly coming to receive had already been transported to Kitale. A senior detective who led the team confirmed that they had arrested 26 out of the 41 council assembly officials sought over misuse of the public funds. &quot;It is true was have managed to arrest 26 officials and we are pursuing more including the Speaker and the Clerk who are at large,&quot; said the officer who declined to be named at Kitale police station. The officers said the officials arrested face charges of abuse of office and misappropriation of public funds among other malpractices. He said some of the wanted officials have fled to neighboring country but promised to hunt them and bring them back. &quot;Communication show that some of the suspects were are looking for are in Uganda and some in Nairobi but we are going to ensure we arrest them,&quot; said the officer.
