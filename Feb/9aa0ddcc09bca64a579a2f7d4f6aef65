Kwale County Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) leaders have endorsed Nicholas Zani to vie for the Senate seat that was held by the late Boy Juma Boy. The senator died suddenly on Saturday and was buried on Sunday. Nicholas Zani, who is the brother of ODM&rsquo;s Secretary General Agnes Zani and the party&rsquo;s Kwale branch vice chairman, had already started campaigns for the Kwale gubernatorial seat. Nicholas ran for the Senate seat in the 2013 elections and finished third after Boy and Chirau Ali Mwakwere. The latter has resigned as Kenya&rsquo;s High Commissioner to Tanzania to vie for governorship against the incumbent Salim Mvurya. &ldquo;As leaders of Kwale, we have sat down and concluded that the only person who can replace Boy Juma Boy is Nicholas Zani,&rdquo; said Sheikh Hamis Banda, who is the chairperson of the Council of Imams.
