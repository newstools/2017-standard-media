Makueni County Assembly Majority Leader Francis Mutuku ordered his bodyguard to shoot area governor in an incident in 2014, a court has heard. Governor Kivutha Kibwana, who was testifying in a case where Mutuku and four APs have been charged with injuring six people after a controversial budget was passed, said as soon as the order was given, gun shots rent the air. The budget was passed on September 23. He said locals had attended a meeting at the county assembly on the fateful day because it had been in public domain. The APs included John Muthoka and Francis Daido who are attached to the county assembly Speaker and Mr Mutuku respectively. Prof Kibwana yesterday told court he heard Mutuku say; &quot;The small man is there, shoot him&#39;, after which he said gun shots rent the air as people fled. &quot;I saw the first accused John Muthoka point a gun at us after which I saw Brian Mutua, one of my bodyguards, fall down,&quot; Kibwana said. He said three injured officers were taken to Makueni county hospital. In his report, Dr Emmanuel Laiposha confirmed those injured had bullet wounds. Kibwana told court area leaders had held a meeting in Mombasa on the controversial budget before the confrontation, adding the attack was politically motivated. The hearing will continue on May 29. &nbsp;
