With eight days to go before the mass voter registration closes, some 137,523 new voters have registered in Kisumu, Siaya and Homa Bay. This falls short of the 460,260 people the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission had targeted. Kisumu is leading having registered 52,303 people against the targeted 177,738. In Homa Bay, IEBC expected to enlist 141,406 people, but has so far managed 49,435. Siaya has enlisted 35,775 new persons out of the targeted 141,116. This means 125,435 people are yet to register in Kisumu, Siaya 105,341 and Homa Bay 91,971. IEBC central Nyanza Coordinator George Oyugi said: &quot;We are urging&nbsp; leaders to work hard to increase the registration percentages, which are arguably still less than 50 per cent, meaning the set targets may not be met on time.&quot; While the effort made by ODM leader Raila Odinga to mobilise people to register has helped, there is need to step up the sensitisation campaign if the targets are to be met.

In Rachuonyo, the latest data showed only 8,139 had so far registered out of the targeted 23,774 new voters, Asiyo said. In Kisumu Central, which lies in the heart of the central business district, only 14,013 people had registered of the targeted 30,981. Kisumu East has enlisted 7,524 new voters against a target of 27,539. In Ndhiwa, Mr Owino claimed increased sanctions in local markets -where it is not easy to enter without confirming that you have registered- had forced locals to enlist. Leaders there are offering free transport and lunch to volunteers who are mobilising locals to register. But Kisumu Deputy Governor Ruth Odinga affirmed that thousands were turning up to register.

Some of the people who registered took IDs 10 years ago but had never bothered to enlist as voters.
