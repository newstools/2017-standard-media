MPs want Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA) boss John Njiraini to explain measures taken to ensure betting firms are tax compliant. The KRA Commissioner General Tuesday failed to honour an invite to appear before the Parliamentary Labour and Social Welfare Committee, prompting members to summon him. The Matungu MP David Were-led committee, had last month written to Mr Njiraini inviting him to make a presentation in relation to the Betting, Lotteries and Gaming (Amendment) Bill, 2016, that is before the National Assembly. He was expected to furnish the committee with a detailed analysis on the tax returns made by all betting companies. Njiraini instead sent two commissioners; Benson Korongo (Domestic Taxes) and Mohamed Mohamud (Strategy Innovation) to represent him, a decision that angered MPs. &quot;We are handling a complex and serious issue. It cannot be delegated to junior officers. The KRA boss should come before us in person,&quot; said Mt Elgon MP John Serut, who termed Njiraini&#39;s excuse that he was busy as baseless.

Mr Were turned away the two KRA officials and directed them to tell their boss to appear before them on Tuesday next week. Last week, Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery announced that the Government had drafted a Bill that seeks to control the multi-billion-shilling betting industry.
