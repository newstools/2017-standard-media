Morocco threatened on Monday to end economic cooperation with the European Union if the bloc did not honour a farming deal, without giving details on the pact or why it might be at risk. The agriculture ministry issued a statement saying the EU should resist any attempts to block Moroccan products entering the EU market. It came a month after the European Court of Justice ruled that deals involving&nbsp;trade of agricultural products, processed agricultural products and fisheries&nbsp;between the EU and Morocco did not apply to the disputed Western Sahara region. The Polisario group seeking independence for the territory described the court&#39;s ruling in December as a victory. In its statement on MAP state news agency, the Moroccan ministry said current agreements with the EU ensured thousands of jobs and and failure of the deals could trigger migrant flows.
