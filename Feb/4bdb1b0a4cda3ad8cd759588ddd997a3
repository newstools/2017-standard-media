Public Service, Youth and Gender Affairs Cabinet Secretary Sicily Kariuki said they have had successful negotiations with the union to give commitment that the Government will implement the salary increment as proposed by Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). She said the move will curb strikes by civil servants over poor payment as well as raise their morale in public service. Speaking in Embu town, the CS said the CBA will be respected and called on public servants to be patient as the new salary structure is being implemented.

Public servants at the same time should exercise patience and restraint when it comes to issues of negotiating for their services,&quot; she said. The new salary structure according to SRC will be implemented in four phases.
