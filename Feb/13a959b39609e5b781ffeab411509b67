TRANS NZOIA, KENYA: The disappearance of several donkeys in Trans-Nzoia County has raised fears of thriving trade in donkey meat in the County. For the past two weeks, water vendors in Kitale have lost their donkeys without trace sparking anxiety in the area. Last week, unknown gang rounded up and stole over 15 donkeys from Bidii and Kibomet estate and owners are yet to recover them. Three residents of Bidii estate within Kitale last week lost 12 donkeys and suspect that the animals were slaughtered and meat sold to unsuspecting members of the public. One of the victims George Wafula, told the Standard that his two donkeys were stolen and have not been recovered. &quot;I just woke up and found my donkeys missing and I have not managed to recover them. I suspect that some unscrupulous butcher operators are playing dirty games with the public,&quot; said Wafula. Gideon Wekesa, who lost four donkeys, is a sad man as he used the animals to earn a living
