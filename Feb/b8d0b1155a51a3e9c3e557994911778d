Jubilee Party (JP) has protested the distribution of Biometric Voter Registration (BVR) machines across the country. Head of Secretariat Raphael Tuju has formerly written to the Independent, Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) questioning the criteria used in their distribution. Yesterday, Mr Tuju sensationally claimed that the electoral body has favoured Opposition strongholds. But in a swift response, IEBC maintained that it had distributed the machines based on the population and size of every. IEBC Corporate Communications Manager Andrew Limo challenged those complaining to consider the two variables before castigating the body for skewed allocations. &quot;We have published our distribution criteria, with allocations based on population and area size,&quot; said Limo. At a press briefing at the party headquarters in Nairobi, Tuju said from their computation, the National Super Alliance/Coalition of Reforms and Democracy zones received some extra 255 BVR machines, even considering the two parameters.

Tuju said, for instance, Tharaka Nithi County was allocated only 82 kits as compared to Siaya, the political bedrock of Opposition chief Raila Odinga, which was assigned 157 kits. Tuju has at the same time urged IEBC not to keep quiet even as the Opposition seem to undermine their credibility and impartiality.
