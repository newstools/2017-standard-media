Private doctors in Mombasa have vowed to paralyse activities in private hospitals for 48 hours starting from Wednesday midnight in solidarity with their colleagues who have been put behind bars. The consultant doctors are calling for the immediate and unconditional release of their colleagues who were Monday sentenced to a one month jail imprisonment for contempt of court. They also want senior officials at Afya house to resign or be sacked for failure to resolve the health crisis in the country. The doctors, who have called upon stakeholders at national and county government to address health crisis, said there will be no negotiations until the jailed doctors are released.
