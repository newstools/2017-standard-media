The Government has&nbsp;slashed funding for Moi Teaching and Referral Hospital (MTRH) from&nbsp;Sh270 million to Sh130 million, a move that has angered MPs. Members of the Parliamentary Committee on Health, who recently toured the hospital, noted that funding was cut without their knowledge. Robert Pukose, the committee&#39;s deputy chairman, said they would table a report in Parliament recommending increased funding to enable the hospital to develop its infrastructure. &quot;It is regrettable that the state slashed the hospital&#39;s budget by more than half. We will push for more funding to allow this hospital to develop further... needs more funding to expand its medical units,&quot; the Endebess MP said. The hospital&#39;s Chief Executive, Wilson Aruasa, said they had handed over a budget proposal to the committee for further scrutiny. &quot;We need to expand the facility, especially the cancer screening centre, which requires modern equipment,&quot; Dr Aruasa said.
