Microsoft plans to launch three cloud-based solutions for African businesses on Liquid Telcom&rsquo;s network. Liquid Telecom is a pan-African telecommunications provider that operates the region&rsquo;s largest independent fibre network, which spans over 40,000km across 12 countries. Microsoft said it will offer fast and affordable cloud-based software offerings, Azure and Office 365. The two firms will also be creating &ldquo;Business in a Box,&rdquo; which will offer small-and-medium businesses a cloud-based toolkit of relevant applications, cloud services and connectivity. This, the firms said, will enhance business potential.
