Eight countries have joined an initiative to raise millions of dollars to replace shortfalls caused by President Donald Trump&#39;s ban on US-funded groups around the world providing information on abortion, Sweden&#39;s deputy prime minister said. Isabella Lovin told Reuters a conference would be held on March 2 in Brussels to kick-start the funding initiative to help non-governmental organizations whose family planning projects could be affected. The Netherlands announced in January the launch of a global fund to help women access abortion services, saying Trump&#39;s &quot;global gag rule&quot; would cause a funding shortfall of $600 million over the next four years. Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Luxemburg, Finland, Canada and Cape Verde have all lent their support, Lovin said. &quot;(The gag order) could be so dangerous for so many women,&quot; said Lovin who posed for a photograph this month with seven other female officials signing an environmental bill, in what was seen a response to a photograph of Trump signing the gag order in the White House with five male advisors. The global gag rule, which affects US non-governmental organizations working abroad, is one that incoming presidents have used to signal their positions on abortion rights. It was created under US President Ronald Reagan in 1984. ALSO READ: Of Robert Mugabe, Donald Trump and Brexiters Trump signed it at a ceremony in the White House on his fourth day in office. Barack Obama lifted the gag rule in 2009 when he took office. &quot;If women don&#39;t have control over their bodies and their own fate it can have very serious consequences for global goals of gender rights and global poverty eradication,&quot; Lovin said.
