A petition before the Senate seeking to legalise the use of banned Cannabis Sativa (bhang) plant in Kenya has faced strong opposition from a section of senators. Nevertheless, despite attracting intense debate in the House on Wednesday, some senators differed with their colleagues and supported the move, saying the plant&rsquo;s by-products can be used after extensive research. The interesting discussions on whether to plant, trade or consume the drug, roped in Nyamira Senator Kenneth Okong&rsquo;o Mong&rsquo;are, who is also eying the presidency in August 8th poll, when he shocked his colleagues by confirming he is a former consumer of bhang. &quot;It doesn&#39;t mean that if the plant is legalized, it will destroy lives. It depends with the level of indulgence. As a juvenile, I used it. I was also in India where the plant is legalized but it is vital if people are disciplined. You can choose not to use it,&quot; said Okong&rsquo;o. He stressed, &quot;As a House, we can come up with regulations that encourage deterrence. The government can allow it but have regulations that restrict use.&quot; In particular, the senators shifted focus and pinned down Okong&rsquo;o on whether his candidature was as a result of the state of mind he finds himself in, after consuming the drug.

Senator Okong&rsquo;o used it but it didn&#39;t prevent him from being a legislator,&quot; said Haji. Okong&rsquo;o defended his decision to run for the presidency, saying he was a former consumer of bhang and it didn&#39;t have any negative effect on him. &quot;I used to use it sometime ago. It didn&#39;t inform my decision to contest for presidency. If the senators want to know about the plant, the House should organise for a retreat to discuss the same,&quot; said the besieged senator.
