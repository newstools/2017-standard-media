Little, a local taxi company Wednesday shared Valentine&rsquo;s love by bailing out a cancer patient who was being held in Kenyatta National Hospital over an outstanding bill of close to Sh.1 Million. The Company&rsquo;s General Manager Ronald Mahondo and Janet Kanini&nbsp;of Ikua Foundation settled the outstanding hospital bill to secure the discharge of 11-year old boy, Stephen who had been diagnosed with chronic Leukemia and was undergoing treatment. &ldquo;I was told of Stephen&rsquo;s plight by one of our staff members and I was moved. As a company that seeks to provide real solutions to Kenyans, we decided to team up with Janet Kanini so that we can get this young boy home with his family,&rdquo; said Ronald. Janet Kanini emerged victorious after battling with lung cancer and expresses her happiness when she sees more corporate entities join in the walk to support cancer patients. &ldquo;As a foundation, our dream is to see every Kenyan and every corporate entity actively join in the cause to ensure timely and successful treatment of cancer. This can be a very expensive venture and it is so refreshing to see companies like Little step in without asking for huge proposals and justifications from the needy,&rdquo; she said.
