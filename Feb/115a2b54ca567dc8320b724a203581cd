Regional retailer Nakumatt Holdings has announced the completion of the first phase of its Warehouse Management System (WMS) integration project. The retailer said the successful completion of the project at its Nairobi logistics hub will now see the deployment of an automated warehousing solution to boost its supply chain efficiencies across the region. Managing Director Atul Shah said the integration of an automated WMS is one of the firm&rsquo;s cost control strategies. He said the new system provides a suitable cash flow management solution as it helps to curb and manage overstocking challenges. He said it also provides Nakumatt with a much-needed corporate transition from manual, to new generation automated stock management systems.
