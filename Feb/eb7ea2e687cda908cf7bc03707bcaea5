On Monday last week, the NSE 20 shaved off 22.40 points to close trading at 2,789.64 points, way below the psychological level of 3,000 points. The latest gain means that since the new month started, the NSE 20 has gained 55.35 points, while the NASI is up by 2.78 points. Last week, NSE Chief Executive Geoffrey Odundo had tipped the market to rebound as investors take advantage of the lower prices to buy shares. Last Friday, the bourse closed with all three indices in the green for the first week since the market opened in 2017. The NSE 20 had gained by 1.79 per cent, while NASI gained 1.56 per cent. The NSE report showed that week-on-week turnover stood at Sh3.1 billion on a volume of 148 million shares, up from Sh2.8 billion on 115 million shares posted the previous week. Safaricom accounted for over half (50.24 per cent) of the week&rsquo;s total turnover. It moved 84 million shares valued at Sh1.5 billion at between Sh18.25 and Sh19.

KCB actively moved 14 million shares valued at Sh335 million, while Equity Group Holdings moved shares worth Sh294 million. Despite the gain on the bourse, the NSE 20 Index is still trading at levels last seen in 2008; raising it beyond 3000 points will require sustained gains. Out of the 25 trading sessions since January 3, the NSE 20 has gained on only five trading sessions, while NASI has been up eight times. Since the year began, the NSE 20 has shed 318.82 points, or 10 per cent, while the NASI is down 8.28 points, or 6.21 per cent.
