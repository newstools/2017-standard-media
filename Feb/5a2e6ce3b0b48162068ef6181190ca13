The Ministry of Tourism has received a report championing the establishment of tourism security services to boost the sector. Cabinet Secretary Najib Balala said implementation of the report of a task force that was formed last year to develop the structure of a Tourism Protection Service (TPS) as well its regulatory framework will help change the perception of tourists about Kenya. &ldquo;We would like a service that will address visitors&rsquo; issues immediately since bureaucratic delays can result in loss of tourism numbers. At the same time, the issue of image building should be a priority,&rdquo; said Mr Balala. The ministry had commissioned a task force to come up with suggestions leading to formation of TPS to cater for security of tourists in the county in the wake of insecurity incidents. Receiving the report in his office yesterday, the CS pledged to roll out an implementation plan soon to fast track the formation of the service. He said by the next financial year, the ministry will give directions on how to implement the report&rsquo;s recommendations in line with the Tourism Act 2011. According to the task force, implementing the TPS will require a two-year road map at a cost of Sh1.77 billion. The Ali Kaka-chaired task force had been charged with developing a code of regulations for the TPS, a criteria for hiring of personnel for the service as well as a curriculum for training the personnel in tourism and hospitality-related matters. Mr Balala said the service would enhance coordinated efforts in addressing visitors&rsquo; concerns.
