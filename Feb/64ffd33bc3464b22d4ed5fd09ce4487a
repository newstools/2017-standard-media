Kalonzo said he had the capacity and ability to lead the country and correct all the mistakes of the Jubilee government, which he described as the worst nightmare to ever happen to Kenyans. Kalonzo said President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto had plunged the country into massive debt. &quot;I am the best suited candidate to lead the country and clean up the mess that Uhuru and Ruto have put the country in,&quot; said Kalonzo in Mombasa on Sunday.

The Wiper leader was addressing Mombasa residents at Kadongo grounds where he received Ali Mbogo, who defected from ODM to Wiper. Kalonzo urged Coast residents to register as voters in large numbers so as to send Jubilee government home in the elections. He said his party would deploy more than 20 youths to each polling station to ensure that there was no rigging by Jubilee.
