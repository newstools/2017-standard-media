A prison warder shot dead his colleague and injured another at Embu Prison Sunday morning under unclear circumstances. Mohamed Said Omar, 34, a Muslim cleric was killed in a hail of bullets while heading to mosque for morning prayers while Kennedy Muriithi Njagi, 28, sustained fractures on both legs from three bullets shot. The suspect Wario Fora Boru, 36, was guarding near the administration block together with Muriithi before turning on them with his gun at around 5am. Officer in charge of the prison Charles Mutembei said Muriithi was first rushed to Embu Children Hospital-Tenri for treatment before being referred to Kijabe Mission Hospital for further treatment. Mutembei said the suspect turned himself up at Itabua police station while the deceased&#39;s body was removed to Embu Level Five Hospital mortuary. He said bad blood between the suspect and the deceased could have arisen in 2015 after the former was appointed to be in charge of the prison mosque, a position he took over from the latter.

He added that police led by county police commander and DCIO had commenced investigations into the incident. &quot;I then heard someone (Muriithi) calling out for help. I told him to put aside his gun and after ascertaining he was not armed I ventured there and found him bleeding profusely. We checked his gun and the bullets were intact. It seemed the shooting caught him by surprise,&quot; said Mutembei. A trail of blood at the area they were guarding showed Muriithi could have dragged himself towards some bushes to escape from the hail of bullets. Mutembei said the suspect could have shot at Muriithi hoping to erase evidence as it was only Muriithi who witnessed the killing.
