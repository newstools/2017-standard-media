NYANDARUA, KENYA: The Nyandarua county government has set aside Sh25 million to mitigate the ongoing drought in the region. Each of the five sub counties will receive Sh5 million in the programme meant to feed those affected by hunger. Among the sub counties are Ndaragwa, Ol Jororok, Ol Kalou, Kipipiri and Kinangop. Governor Daniel Waithaka said that his administration had initiated the programme as most parts of the county have not received rains for the last five months. He said primary schools affected by lack of food would be supplied with relief food as part of the programme. &quot;We will not allow any family in the county to sleep hungry due to lack of food. That is why we have set aside the money to mitigate the crisis as we wait for the rains,&quot; he said. &quot;No child should also go to school hungry and that is why we will supply the schools in drought ravaged areas with relief food. This is meant to make sure that the education standards of our children are not affected by hunger,&quot; he added. Waithaka regretted that the lower parts of Ndaragwa sub-county had been adversely affected by drought thereby calling on the national government to also intervene. &quot;The county government cannot afford to feed all the affected persons in this region adequately and that is why we call upon the national government to look into ways that we can partner so that these people are fed properly. Most of them are sleeping hungry and adequate measures have to be taken before the situation gets worse,&quot; he said.
