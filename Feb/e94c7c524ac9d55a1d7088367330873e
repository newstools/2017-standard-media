Stepping into the bathtub and noticing that the shower curtain is dotted with mildew can make one uncomfortable. However, even if you are using a plastic liner or washable plastic shower curtain, it is easy to get it clean within a short period of time. Take it off the rod The only way to clean your curtain effectively is to take it off the rod and wash it. Separate the shower curtain from the shower curtain liner. You can wash them both the same way, but depending on what the actual shower curtain is, that could change. However, since one might want to add something to the soap, or wash at a different temperature, for a cloth curtain as opposed to the plastic liners, it is always advisable to separate them but if they are of the same material, wash them together. Clean the curtain Clean vinyl, nylon, cotton, or hemp liner in hot water and mild detergent. Then shake and rehang the liner to dry. Make sure you do not place it in the dryer. Give liners a good wash at the start of every season Hand-wash Hand-wash your liner if the care label does not recommend machine. Take the curtain outside and scrub it with a solution of 10 parts water to one part chlorine bleach, using a plastic-bristled brush. Let it dry in the sun until any mould or discoloration has faded, then rinse. Always prevent grime Avoid grime by cutting your shower liner so it does not drag on the shower floor. This will keep dust and moisture from getting trapped in it. After a shower, shake off as much water as possible, and pull the liner closed so moisture doesn&rsquo;t collect in the folds.
