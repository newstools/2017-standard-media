Police are on the hunt for a high school teacher accused of attempted rape. A Form One student at Kambara Secondary School in Mathioya claimed the suspect offered her a lift to school. On arrival, she says, the suspect gave her some exam papers and directed her to deliver them in the staff room on Friday. It was at this point that she alleged the teacher tried to defile her, fortunately she managed to escape. Speaking at Kangema District Hospital where she underwent counseling, she said she ran home to share her tribulations with the grandmother who also took her to hospital. She was diagnosed at the Nyakianga Health Centre where it was established that she had been hurt. Her parents have urged the school to ensure the suspect is brought to book. County police commander Naomi Ichami said they have launched investigations into the matter.
