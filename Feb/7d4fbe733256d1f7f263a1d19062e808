Safaricom has partnered with the Kenya Alliance of Resident Associations (KARA) to improve security for residents. The partnership will see Safaricom cooperate with KARA in laying out and maintaining telecommunication systems for use in deploying technology to enhance security. &ldquo;We will employ technology, including Close Circuit Televisions, Electromagnetic Fields to address challenges like insecurity that is emerging everyday,&rdquo; said Safaricom&rsquo;s chief executive officer Bob Collymore. Other infrastructure will include laying of fibre optic cables to ensure continuous Internet in estates to avoid inconveniences being experienced today. &ldquo;Technology offers a huge opportunity to enhance the quality of life in neighbourhoods across the country. This partnership opens the door in creating solutions that will promote sustainable development in our neighbourhoods. This is in line with our agenda to transform lives of Kenyans,&rdquo; said Collymore. Henry Ochieng&rsquo;, KARA chief executive officer, said the partnership with Safaricom would boost the organisation&rsquo;s efforts to ensure living space that permits a life of dignity for all. &ldquo;We look forward to working with Safaricom in tackling the service delivery challenges that many Kenyans face in their neighbourhoods.
