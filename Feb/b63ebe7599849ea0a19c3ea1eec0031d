&nbsp; Angry residents of Yala in Siaya County set an Administration Police post on fire after a man was allegedly tortured to death while in custody. The residents stormed Anyiko Police Station at 5pm on Monday and evicted the officers on duty before torching the station and four residential houses, and vandalising other facilities in the compound. They claimed an officer from the station had arrested a resident, Erick Ouma, near a drinking den at about 7am and beaten him to death. However, Siaya County Police Commandant Betty Gachago denied that the man died at the police post. She said he had been arrested for being drunk and started vomiting before police rushed him to Yala Sub-County Hospital where he died.
