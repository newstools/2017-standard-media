Amani National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Godfrey Osotsi has urged the committee tasked with selecting National Super Alliance (NASA) flag bearer to hasten the process. Mr Osotsi said time was running out since the alliance needs more time to set up other structures. &quot;A majority of Kenyans are anxious and looking forward to having a single Opposition candidate,&quot; Osotsi said. While speaking to journalists at Mbale in Vihiga County, Osotsi called on the committee to vet NASA&#39;s four presidential hopefuls and give the opposition a winning team. &quot;Generally, ANC is backing Mudavadi to lead the Opposition but our position still remains that any other candidate arrived at will be supported fully,&quot; he said. &nbsp;PARTY PRIMARIES ALSO READ: Kalonzo: Why I&rsquo;m not leaving Raila He said the decision that will be made will determine how other parties will conduct their primaries and if possible, where to have compromised candidates. &quot;The decision of the committee will help solve impasse in some regions where several candidates are in the alliance and going for the same seat,&quot; he said. Last weekend while in Vihiga County, Kisumu Senator Anyang&#39; Nyong&#39;o urged the leaders, especially MPs, to give the committee ample time to choose a preferred candidate. Osotsi further dispelled claims that there were preferred candidates in some areas who had already been given nomination certificates. &nbsp;
