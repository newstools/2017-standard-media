Orange South Africa is seeking deals in Africa as France&rsquo;s biggest wireless carrier targets the continent as a source of additional revenue growth. &ldquo;We are looking for acquisition opportunities in Africa, it is a priority region for us,&rdquo; Yannick Decaux, Orange&rsquo;s commercial director for Africa said in an interview in Johannesburg on Thursday. &ldquo;We are speaking to everyone.&rdquo; European phone companies are seeking ways to boost sales amid static and saturated markets on their home continent, where competition authorities have ruled to cut roaming fees. Demand for higher-margin wireless data is growing in Africa as internet speeds improve and smartphones become more available and affordable. Orange has units in sub-Saharan African countries, including Botswana, Cameroon and Ivory Coast.
