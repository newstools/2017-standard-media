The suffering that the doctors&rsquo; strike has occasioned continues to be felt across the country. The case of Gertrude Lusia and her son Granious Waweru, who suffers from blood cancer, is really touching. Lusia cannot afford the Sh40,000 a private facility is demanding to attend to her son. There is no pain more harrowing to a parent than to watch their children suffer the pain of disease, wither away before their own eyes knowing there is nothing they can do about it. Granious&rsquo;s case represents many who continue to suffer because doctors have deserted hospitals for 66 straight days, yet financial constraints do not allow them to seek medical attention in private clinics and hospitals. Efforts to reach an agreement between striking doctors and the Health Cabinet secretary have hit a brick wall. There is an element of mistrust on both sides that fails to take into account the urgency needed to resolve the impasse. The threat of a jail sentence hanging over the union officials, even though suspended thrice, does not aid matters. Gratifyingly, the Senate has taken steps towards averting a crisis that has already consigned many to early graves. But with the Government having already trashed the 2013 Comprehensive Bargaining Agreement and stated the economy could not support the doctors&rsquo; demands, it remains to be seen how Senate handles this matter to the satisfaction of all. Central Organisation of Trade Unions Secretary General Francis Atwoli has offered to mediate between the striking doctors and the Government. Whatever effort that might bear fruit and convince doctors to go back to work is welcome. This impasse cannot be allowed to go on indefinitely, and this newspaper urges doctors once more to take pity on patients and adhere to the Hippocratic Oath while efforts are made to meet their demands for better pay and working conditions. We cannot begrudge them that. ALSO READ: Court further suspends doctors&rsquo; union officials jail term
