Dorcas Wainaina has taken over as executive director of the&nbsp; Institute of Human Resource Management (IHRM). IHRM is the State agency that oversees the functions of the human resource profession in the country. The Institute has gone through tremendous changes since the enactment of the Human Resource Management Professional (HRMP) Act in 2012. Ms Wainaina&rsquo;s appointment comes at a time when the institute has intensified efforts to weed out quacks masquerade as practitioners and consultants both in the public and private sectors. Prior to her appointment, Ms Wainaina served as a council member representing IHRM&rsquo;s Nairobi region. She beat 22 other contenders for the post and takes over from Samson Osero. Ms Wainaina is the first female executive director in the institute&rsquo;s 30-year history. &ldquo;I am delighted to be granted this opportunity to serve. Going forward, we shall continue to have an open-door policy as we encourage more partners and stakeholder engagements to grow the HR profession. I encourage knowledge sharing and innovation as we embrace technology,&rdquo; she said.
