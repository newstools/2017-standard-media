There is no hope the doctor&#39;s strike will end any time soon despite a long meeting between their representatives and the Central Organisation of Trade Unions (Cotu).&nbsp; It was not immediately clear what Cotu and Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) officials discussed as the strike enters its 67th day. Meanwhile, the Government remained mum on the matter, even after a meeting between KMPDU, Cotu and the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR) drafted a return-to-work formula. This came as the Kenya Medical Women Association (KMWA) called for a quick solution to the strike. KMWA chairperson Christine Sadia wants both sides to drop their hard-line stances and come up with a win-win solution to the crisis. &quot;This strike has gone on too long and it is time a solution was reached. We cannot continue this way,&quot; Dr Sadia said.
