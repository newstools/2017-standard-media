Opposition leaders have rubbished Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s assertion that Jubilee Party has garnered enough new voters to win the August 8 elections. Mr Ruto predicted on Wednesday that Jubilee was well on its way to victory, citing higher registration of voters in the party&#39;s perceived strongholds. But in a rejoinder yesterday, Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi dismissed the DP&#39;s assertion, saying despite the slow pace of issuing national ID cards in perceived Opposition strongholds, they still had the numbers to beat Jubilee. Mr Mudavadi said among the issues they had raised with the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) were delays in issuing ID cards and use of Government officials to drive voter registration in Jubilee Party strongholds. &quot;There has been a slow-down in the issuing of IDs in Opposition strongholds. The process is skewed to favour Jubilee and this is now creating despondency among our supporters,&quot; said Mudavadi. He called on Opposition supporters&nbsp; to ignore Ruto&#39;s assertion on Jubilee&#39;s new voter numbers.

They have nowhere to run because they know the National Super Alliance (NASA) will form the next government,&quot; he said. Mudavadi maintained that the Opposition would not accept another flawed election and demanded that IEBC address issues raised by the Opposition in time for Kenyans to have confidence in the management of the elections. NASA&#39;s Head of Secretariat Norman Magaya dismissed the numbers and figures cited by Ruto as propaganda to discourage Opposition supporters from continuing to register as voters. Mr Magaya argued that the actual statistics in NASA strongholds stood at 1,127,000 new registered voters as per IEBC&#39;s third week updates, compared to Jubilee&#39;s 938,000. PANIC MODE &quot;Jubilee is in panic mode and are using propaganda to paint a picture that they are doing well even when the figures are showing otherwise. Once the (voter) register is cleaned, it will show the difference,&quot; said Magaya. He said NASA had secured a huge following in Western, Nyanza, Central Rift, Garissa, Wajir, Coast, Lower Eastern, parts of North Rift and South Rift.

He argued that highlighting percentages instead of absolute figures hid the fact that in actual numbers, more voters had been registered in Opposition counties than in Jubilee-dominated ones. &quot;Week three reports showed that NASA registered 1,052,773 voters against Jubilee&#39;s 893,409,&quot; said Mr Ong&#39;wen. He said even though Jubilee seemed to be leading, actual figures put NASA strongholds ahead. &quot;The narrative that Jubilee is leading is being popularised to justify the intended manipulation of the electoral outcome,&quot; he said. &nbsp; &nbsp; ALSO READ: President Uhuru: Youth vote will shape Kenya's future
