It is now easier for individuals and small businesses to see how much they can save on their printing expenses, thanks to the new Epson&rsquo;s online calculator. Using the calculator, individuals and small businesses can now compare the top 20 best-selling printers against Epson&rsquo;s Ink Tank System (ITS) printers to find out which is the most economical for their printing needs. The online calculator helps users understand the total cost of ownership by examining both the upfront cost of a printer and its running costs related to ink so that they can make an informed decision. Epson&rsquo;s ITS range of printers have presented a new proposition where users can benefit from low running costs by investing in a printer that comes with two years&rsquo; worth of ink.&nbsp; Epson East Africa Regional Sales Manager Mukesh Bector said the firm had demonstrated a deep understanding of its customers by consistently offering a guarantee of the lowest cost of printing in the market. He said locally, there has been a considerable uptake in the adoption of ITS printers, especially among small businesses.
