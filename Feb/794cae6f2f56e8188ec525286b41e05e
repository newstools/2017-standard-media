The Court has sentenced Doctors&rsquo; union officials to one month in jail after they failed to reach an agreement and call off medics strike as directed. The Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) officials appeared in Milimani Law Courts earlier this morning. Judge Hellen Wasilwa had suspended their jail term and directed Central Organization of Trade Union (COTU) Secretary General Francis Atwoli to lead negotiations to bring an end to the industrial action. The meeting which included KMPDU officials, Council of Governors, the Treasury, Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC) and other Government organs hit a deadlock after the doctors refused another deal offered by the government arguing that it is not what they were bargaining for. The doctors&rsquo; union officials insisted on the implementation of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA). &nbsp; ALSO READ: More effort necessary to end doctors' strike
