Wiper Party leader Kalonzo Musyoka has called on the Government to resolve issues raised by doctors to end their strike. Speaking yesterday in Kisii County while on a tour to mobilise residents to register as voters, Kalonzo said the Government must make a bold move and save Kenyans from the health sector crisis. He said patients were being exposed to unnecessary suffering following the doctors&#39; strike, which has entered its third month. Kalonzo, who met clinicians and other medical officers in Kisii town, said many Kenyans had lost hope in the country&#39;s health services because of lack of goodwill from the Government to improve services. &quot;We need a government that can solve issues affecting this country. The coming elections will determine the destiny of our country,&quot; he said. Kalonzo opened the party&#39;s offices in Kisii town where he was on his second day of tour to popularise his party and campaign for its aspirants.
