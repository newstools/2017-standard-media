The Kenya premier league is likely not to take off on schedule due to wrangles between the Kenya Premier League (KPL) and Football Kenya Federation (FKF). Over the years, this has become the norm rather than the exception, to the detriment of local football. FKF and KPL have always been at loggerheads over whether 16 or 18 teams should participate in the premier league. The inclusion of Sofapaka and Muhoroni football clubs in the premier league is the latest bone of contention. Their appeal to the Sports Dispute Tribunal is yet to be determined. But having failed to meet the new licensing rules by Confederation of African Football, FKF President Nick Mwendwa is reluctant to allow Sofapaka and Muhoroni to participate in the league, and for good reason. Many have been the times when clubs promoted to the premier league fail to honour matches and pay players their dues due to financial constraints. This not only takes out the thrill from football, it demoralises players. For a country that once dominated football rankings in East and Central Africa, Kenya&rsquo;s Fifa rankings have been depressing for a long time. Rather than operate antagonistically, KPL and FKF must work harmoniously to streamline the running of football in the country. Reclaiming our lost glory is of paramount importance.
