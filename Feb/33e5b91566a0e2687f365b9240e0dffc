ELDORET, KENYA: Cases of post-harvest losses in Uasin Gishu is set to reduce following the construction of a modern potato storage facility. The project which is through a collaboration of a Dutch company and the county is expected to provide storage for a span of between six months to a year. The area deputy governor Daniel Chemno said the 300 feet long potato cold room facility is the only one so far built in East and Central Africa. &quot;It is one of the achievements that the county has made and will cushion farmers against losses as well as providing them an opportunity to store the produce as they seek good prices,&quot; he explained. Chemno observed that the storage is made up of insulated walls that will be able to control aeration as it retains cool temperatures. He noted that the region has close to 2,000 potato farmers producing an average of 2 acres that translate to 100 bags mostly sold in the local markets within the county and western parts.
