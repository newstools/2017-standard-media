Kenyans who share national identity card or passport details have 10 days to correct the anomaly failing which their names will be struck off the voter register. Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Chief Executive Officer Ezra Chiloba yesterday said there were 128,926 documented cases of voters with shared ID cards numbers in the voter register. &quot;A total of 50,174 ID card numbers were confirmed to be legitimate hence accepted as part of the register. The commission has now published the remaining 78,752 voters with shared ID numbers. This includes 21,149 records bearing the same ID numbers and same names, and 57,603 whose ID numbers did not match the National Bureau Registration records we submitted for verification,&quot; said Mr Chiloba.
