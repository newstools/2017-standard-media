In a new video shared on his Facebook wall, the Tour guide now known as Saimon, appeared with the same female tourist offering words of apology about their jokes, saying that they were misunderstood. Earlier reports had stated that the guide was charged in court for defaming his country and giving false information about its people. In the initial video, the tour guide claimed that the tourist said she wanted Tanzanians to stop complaining about hunger and that they should boil their clothes and eat them. But in a new video, the Tour guide condemned the manner in which the video was shared on social media, saying that it has jeopardize his reputation as a professional tour guide. Confirming the initial incidence, the female tourist said, she and Simon were just &quot;having fun.&quot; &ldquo;Hi again!&nbsp; Part two of our video,&nbsp; We were just playing around doing a little joke, Simon was being a comedian and we were just doing a little joke on Facebook. So... thanks and it was just a joke, &ldquo;she said. When it was Saimon&rsquo;s turn to speak, he said they were out &#39;to clear the air&#39; on the first video that landed him in hot water. &ldquo;Just the way you know it in the initial video, I have been a tour guide for ten years,&rdquo; he said in Swahili. &ldquo;I cannot tolerate any bad talk against my country, whoever downloaded the video from my Facebook account then shared it on whatsup group did not do the right thing.&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;The video was just a comedy, it was for fun, and I know there are people who are offended by this video. &ldquo;It was not my intention to hurt anyone, I apologize to my fans and followers, continue receiving entertainment, but just note my offensive jokes were misunderstood. Thank you,&rdquo; he added. Below is the original video showing the Tanzanian tour guide falsely translating tourist&rsquo;s comments: &nbsp;
