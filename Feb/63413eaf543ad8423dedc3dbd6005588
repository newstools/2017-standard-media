Former National Assembly Speaker Kenneth Marende has given the strongest indication yet which side he will be working with as he leaves Government to run for political office. Mr Marende, who is expected to quit his position as chairman of the Kenya Power board, spent the better part of Monday with CORD leader Raila Odinga where he revealed he would today make &lsquo;a major statement&rsquo; on his political future. Sources told The Standard that the former Emuhaya MP met Mr Raila at his Bondo home and the two drove to Kisumu in one vehicle where they visited a former minister in the Jomo Kenyatta Government, Joseph Otiende, who is admitted to Avenue Hospital in Kisumu.
