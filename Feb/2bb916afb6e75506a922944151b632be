A 38-year-old farm worker has committed suicide after his employer failed to pay him for two years. Nelson Anyamba stabbed himself to death after his monthly salary of Sh5,000 per month went unpaid for 24 months. According to his wife, Phyllis Sariku, Anyamba&#39;s employer reneged on paying the full amount, insisting on deducting 24 month&#39;s pay to cater for milk allegedly taken by the deceased&#39;s family. &quot;The agreement between my husband and the employer was to get Sh5,000 every month. This adds up Sh120,000. When he asked to be paid he was told that the cost of milk had been deducted from his salary and was only given Sh5,000. He refused to take it and went out. I was shocked to find him dead next to the pit latrine,&quot; she said. She said her husband had planned to buy a piece of land with the salary arrears. But his employer, Ms Esther Akisali, denied falling out with the deceased, saying before he died, he had suddenly announced that he was quitting the same night. &quot;I asked him why he was leaving that night and tried convincing him to leave the following day but he refused and said he had found a new place to stay,&quot; she said. She denied quarreling with Anyamba before he committed suicide. &quot;He has lived with me for more than three years and we have never had any misunderstanding. He even has three cows which he has been keeping here. I don&#39;t understand the cause of the problem because when I returned in the evening I found him packing his belongings,&quot; she said. A member of the community policing in the area, Erick Nalianya, said the matter had been reported to relevant the authorities for investigation. Officer Commanding Likuyani Police Station Meshack Kiptum urged employees to follow the law whenever they have a misunderstanding with their employers instead of resorting to desperate measures. &quot;Committing suicide does not help. We have labour courts that deal with salary disputes,&quot; he said.
