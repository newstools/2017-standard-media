ODM Director of Communications Philip Etale termed him a darling of the people of Kwale and Coast. &ldquo;A jovial man he was. A man full of humour and no time for hate. Sen. Boy Juma Boy leaves a rich legacy and big gap to fill,&rdquo; said Etale on his twitter handle @EtalePhilip.&nbsp; &ldquo;ODM has lost two of the finest crowd movers in the history of rallies in KE (Kenya); Boy Juma Boy and&nbsp;Otieno Kajwang&#39;&nbsp;Irreplaceable,&rdquo; tweeted @ochievans . Another twitter user @japhol2010 posted: &ldquo;#RIPBoyJumaBoy He was a dramatic and active speakers in the senate. I shall miss his Kiswahili. I condole with his family and electorates&rdquo;. Boy&rsquo;s death comes five months before the next General Election. He had been missing from the limelight for a while and his demise leaves behind a vacant seat in Senate which will likely be filled through a by-election.&nbsp; Senator Boy succeeded his father, Juma Boy, as Matuga MP in 1983 and later retained the seat in the 1988 and 1992 elections. He was elected Kwale Senator in the March 4, 2013 general election after trouncing Jubilee Party&rsquo;s Ali Chirau Mwakwere, now Ambassador of Kenya to Tanzania. He also served at the Central Organisation of Trade Unions (COTU) where he championed for the rights of workers during the Moi regime.
