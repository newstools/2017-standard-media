Kiambu Governor William Kabogo has downplayed the alliance by five aspirants seeking to challenge him in the August 8 elections, saying he will still defeat them. Speaking during a meet-the-people tour in Ruiru town yesterday, Mr Kabogo said he was not worried because he was confident that his track record was convincing enough to get him re-elected. &quot;I hear that five people have come together with the sole aim of defeating me. I want to let them know that I will show them dust at the ballot. This year&#39;s election will be my fifth one and I can tell you I&#39;m not prepared to lose,&quot; he said. The governor told residents to be wary of his rivals, who were &quot;advancing their own selfish interests&quot;. Speaking at a meeting convened to pray for the country in Thika town last weekend, five aspirants announced they had commenced negotiations to back one of them to face Kabogo in the forthcoming elections. In what they described as the &quot;Thika Declaration&quot;, Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu, James Nyoro, David Ngari commonly known as Gakuyo, John Mugwe and Njoki Gathendu said the person they agreed to support would face Kabogo in the Jubilee Party primaries slated for April.

But their quest for unity appeared short-lived as Mr Nyoro denied there was such a deal. This was after Waititu, during a Citizen TV show, said the aspirants had agreed to step down for him to run against Kabogo.
