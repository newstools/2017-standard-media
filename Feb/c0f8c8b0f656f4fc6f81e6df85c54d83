A land surveyor was sentenced to two years in jail after he was found guilty of obtaining money by false pretences. Seth Madegwa was accused of obtaining Sh18,000 from Japheth Omule in October 2016 claiming he would facilitate a land transfer. Senior Resident Magistrate James Ong&#39;ondo heard that Madegwa and Omule tried to settle the issue out of court but the accused proved cagey, prompting the complainant to take the matter to police. Madegwa pleaded guilty and asked the court for leniency, saying this was his first offence and that he is an orphan. He has two weeks to appeal.
