Up to 10,000 youths have been picked to join the KCB Foundation&rsquo;s 2Jiajiri technical and vocational training scholarships programme. The foundation is using a franchise model and joint venture partnerships in a bid to link beneficiaries with training and market access. The structure of the partnerships, said KCB, allows 2jiajiri beneficiaries to have a stake in the ownership of businesses that they establish in conjunction with the partnering companies. This is either through a joint-venture, franchise agreements or branch-operator model. The 2017 beneficiaries commissioned on Tuesday by President Uhuru Kenyatta will join 70 vocational and technical training institutions across the country from this week.
