Governor Peter Munya will launch a mortuary at the Nyambene Level 4 Hospital in Maua, making it the second public hospital in the county to have such a facility. The mortuary, with the capacity to preserve 30 bodies, is intended to ease congestion at the Meru Referral and Teaching Hospital. Other units will be installed at the Githongo, Miathene, and Muthaara sub-district hospitals. The county assembly approved Sh32 million to fund the facilities.
