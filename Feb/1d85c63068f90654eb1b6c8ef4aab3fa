Police on Wednesday seized two sacks of bhang with an estimated street value of Sh300,000 at a posh house in Maragua. The officers raided a two-bedroom house in Milimani Estate where they discovered bhang hidden in one of the rooms. Police used force to gain entry into the house after the occupants defied orders to open. Three suspects, among them a 19-year-old girl believed to have been employed by a Tanzanian to package the drugs, were arrested. County Commissioner John Elungata had last week ordered police to comb areas suspected to harbour drug peddlers following an intelligence report of increased smoking among the youth. Murang&#39;a South OCPD Paul Wanjama said the police are pursuing the land lord as the main suspect as he had failed to notify the police on &#39;behaviours&#39; of his tenant.
