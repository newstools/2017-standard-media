Narok Governor Samuel Tunai has said the recent forays by the National Super Alliance (NASA) into the county will not change the voting pattern. Mr Tunai said efforts by the Opposition alliance to woo the Maasai would not bear any fruit and termed the recent visits &quot;a complete waste of time&quot;. &quot;Raila was a prime minister for five years, Kalonzo served as deputy president for a similar period. Between these two individuals, nothing was ever done to benefit the Maasai community,&quot; Tunai said after a friendly football match between Narok Combined and Kenya Premier League side AFC Leopards in Narok at the weekend. &quot;The Jubilee government&#39;s development record for the Maasai people speaks for itself. When we talk about rural electrification, Jubilee has connected 42,000 households to the national grid. For more than 70 years, the previous governments only managed to connect 7,000 households.&quot; The Opposition alliance was in South Rift region last week when they held a rally in Bomet before proceeding to Narok North, where MP Moitalel ole Kenta decamped to ODM from Jubilee. During the rally, Opposition chief Raila Odinga urged the Jubilee government to implement the Truth, Justice and Reconciliation Commission (TJRC) report as well as address land injustices suffered by the Maasai community.

When James Orengo (Siaya senator) was the Lands minister, what land injustices did he resolve for the Maasai community?&quot; he posed. Speaking on Mr Kenta&#39;s defection, Tunai said the MP&#39;s decision wouldn&#39;t change the fortunes of the party in the constituency. &quot;As Jubilee, we don&#39;t want to see anyone leave the party, but Kenta&#39;s decision does not surprise anyone who understands the politics of Narok,&quot; the governor explained. &quot;Kenta benefited from loyal Jubilee supporters who voted for him against the late William ole Ntimama; in fact, Kenta supported my rival in ODM.&quot;
