Facebook Inc is creating an app for television set-top boxes, including Apple Inc&#39;s Apple TV, the Wall Street Journal reported, citing people familiar with the matter. The world&#39;s biggest online social network is also in discussions with media companies to license long-form, TV-quality programming, the Journal reported on Tuesday. (on.wsj.com/2kNGMgx) Facebook declined to comment. An app for set-top boxes would bring Facebook closer to live video and video advertisements. Getting advertisers to buy more video ads is key to Facebook&#39;s continued revenue growth as such ads fetch higher rates from advertisers than text or photo-based ads. Live video is also becoming a highly competitive feature on social platforms, with companies competing to stream major sports events and exclusive video components from high-profile events such as the Oscar and Grammy awards shows. In April, Facebook expanded its live video product, Facebook Live - a potential threat to broadcast television, giving it prominent placement on its app and rolling out features to make it easier for users to search and comment in real time.
