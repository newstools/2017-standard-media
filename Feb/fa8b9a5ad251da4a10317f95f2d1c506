Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi has claimed the Government is planning to increase taxes to plug holes in its Sh2.6 trillion 2017-18 budget. He said the Jubilee government has continued to subject Kenyans to economic torture by paying huge international debts. Speaking in Kisii during voter mobilisation yesterday, Mudavadi called on Kenyans to stand against the current Government&#39;s borrowing trends. &quot;There is a big gap in the budget and poor Kenyans should not be subjected to pay for such mistakes. This is a creation of the Jubilee government to swindle money from poor Kenyans,&quot; he said. Mudavadi asked Kenyans to brace for hard times in footing the Sh900 billion deficit. He said the deficit, the largest the country has ever had, was a pointer to Jubilee government&#39;s lack of proper strategy. &quot;The financing gap created by the Jubilee government simply means that Kenyans should brace for more loans being borrowed and taxes being increased,&quot; he said. presidential ambitions ALSO READ: Let&rsquo;s all stop paying taxes until Mudavadi also said he is ready to sacrifice his presidential ambitions for the sake of continued unity in the National Super Alliance (NASA). Mr Mudavadi vowed to ensure the alliance remained united until Jubilee is dislodged from power, even if he does not become the coalition&#39;s flag bearer. Speaking to journalists after visiting ailing former Cabinet minister Joseph Otiende at Avenue Hospital in Kisumu, Mudavadi reiterated the need for a united Opposition which would bring the kind of leadership Kenya needs. &quot;I pushed for NASA because I wanted the unity of the Opposition. That was the primary objective of the idea behind having NASA. I will still be in NASA, even if I fail to be crowned the coalition&#39;s flag bearer,&quot; he said. &quot;When you have created something; when you have midwifed a child, you don&#39;t run away from your child. NASA is now a serious movement and I won&#39;t run away from it.&quot;
