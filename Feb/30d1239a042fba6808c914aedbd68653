Teaches Service Commission (TSC) has insisted that it will not relax the new regulations that rule out interference of normal learning programmes with non-academic activities. Following protests from teachers&#39; unions, the commission has stated that the new rules will not be changed and warned that absence of a teacher from school without documentation will be met with strict disciplinary action. &quot;Absence from school by a teacher or head of institution, including on official assignments should be documented and entered in the school log book,&quot; said the Commission&#39;s head of Communication Kihumba Kamotho. He said from now on, activities like head teachers&#39; conferences that are usually held during school days will happen during the holidays because they keep heads of institutions away from their places of work for upto a week. At least 7,000 school principals and 22,000 head teachers are usually away during this annual event. &quot;This is intended to strengthen supervision of learning activities, which is basic to implementation of curriculum,&quot; said Kamotho.

But Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) has protested the new rules saying it is a plot to punish teachers. &quot;Teachers are not refusing to teach but the focus should be on employing more teachers not making them work on weekends and holidays,&quot; Knut Secretary General Wilson Sossion said.
