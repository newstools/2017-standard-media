Jubilant lawyers at New York&#39;s leading airport on Saturday urged visa holders from seven predominantly Muslim countries to fly to the United States immediately while Donald Trump&#39;s travel ban remains in tatters. Volunteers manning a crisis-management headquarters behind a diner at John F. Kennedy International Airport breathed a collective sigh of relief on Saturday, delighted that one week after the explosive order came into effect a federal judge in Seattle had suspended it. Renee Paradis, 39, who has a solo practice in New York and worked on Senator Bernie Sanders&#39; failed presidential bid last year, said the sense of happiness contrasted sharply with the gloom of a week earlier over deportations. &quot;It was just incredibly chaotic and stressful and really worrisome and just heartbreaking,&quot; she said, recalling one woman who was saved only when her plane turned back after a judge issued a temporary stay. &quot;Today is definitely a better Saturday,&quot; she said. &quot;It&#39;s definitely more excited and jubilant that we&#39;re actually going to hopefully see some folks coming in who haven&#39;t been able to come in before.&quot; ALSO READ: Trump names former 'black site' prison operator CIA deputy chief Paradis, the on-site coordinator for the day and working her fourth shift, said the group based at Terminal 4 had assisted at least 199 families over the past week. But while the team began the day optimistic that affected travelers would soon arrive, by sundown there had been only anecdotal reports of arrivals, with more expected on Sunday. Confusion also lingered as authorities digested the ramifications both of the federal judge&#39;s ruling suspending the presidential order and of the White House&#39;s vow that the Justice Department would challenge the decision. At least one person bound for New York was prevented from boarding by an airline, said Paradis. Seventeen or 18 others did make it through Logan airport in Boston, she said. One was a female graduate student studying in New York. State Governor Andrew Cuomo said that a four-month-old Iranian baby and her family had been given clearance for the infant to undergo heart surgery. Lingering confusion It was unclear what would happen to people whose visas had been canceled. Some volunteers said they expected many travelers to wait a few days for greater certainty before purchasing expensive tickets.

Clare Kane, a student intern at the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, said in a statement that her group had been in contact with hundreds of people impacted by the ban. &quot;The Trump administration has said they will appeal the judge&#39;s ruling -- so people should get on planes as soon as possible,&quot; she said. Back at JFK, one New Yorker, film studies professor Lindley Hanlon, donned a home-made Statue of Liberty costume and staked out Terminal 4 to greet those arriving to the symbol of US immigration and freedom.

Halfway through the afternoon, after spending long hours on her feet, she called it a day.
