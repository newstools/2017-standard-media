MOMBASA, KENYA: The anti-counterfeit agency in Mombasa nabbed contraband HP, Dell computer accessories and Toyota motor vehicle spare parts worth over seven million shillings at the port of Mombasa. The contraband goods were recovered in a container at Kenya Ports Authority terminal during the verification process by the agencies. Chief Anti-counterfeit inspector Mombasa Branch Ibrahim Bulle said that the contraband were headed to Kampala from China. &quot;During our sporadic checks acting on information, we managed to confiscate HP and Della accessories and Toyota products worth over seven million. The owners of the brand are in Nairobi and have recorded the statements with us and investigations are ongoing,&quot; said Bulle. The inspector said the container had consolidated cargo and the computer accessories were concealed with other cargo. According to the ship&#39;s manifesto, the cargo originated from Nansha China and the exporter was Zhuhui A- Stone Importer and exporter Company Limited. The owner is said to be Sakira Martin running Mashzi Supply and Importers Company in Kampala. Bulle said that Martin was in Kenya and had already recorded a statement with the agency and investigations were still ongoing. Contraband are usually concealed in the middle of the container and it becomes hard to check on all the containers passing through the port because it will cause a grid lock on the flow of cargo at the port. Bulle urged all the brand owners whose products had been named should come forward and record statements to enable legal action be taken against those importing contraband.
