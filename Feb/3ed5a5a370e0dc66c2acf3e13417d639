Four hundred people in Mumias East have benefited from government relief food. The beneficiaries, mostly widows, the elderly, people living with disabilities, and orphans, received 300 bags of maize, 52 bags of beans, 100 bags of rice, and cooking oil. &quot;Many vulnerable people in the constituency have been hard hit by hunger. We requested the government to donate some food to be distributed to them,&quot; said Mr Willy Cheboi, the deputy county commissioner of Mumias East. Mr Cheboi said most local farmers prefer cane growing to subsistence farming. &quot;Cane farming has contributed to hunger in the region,&quot; he said.
