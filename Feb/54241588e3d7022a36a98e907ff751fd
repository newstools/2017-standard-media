Tehran: Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dismissed US&nbsp;President Donald Trump&#39;s warning to Tehran to stop its missile tests, and called on Iranians to respond to Trump&#39;s &quot;threats&quot; on Friday&#39;s anniversary of the 1979 revolution. &quot;No enemy can paralyze the Iranian nation,&quot; Khamenei was quoted as saying by his website in a meeting with military commanders in Tehran. &quot;[Trump] says &#39;you should be afraid of me&#39;. No! The Iranian people will respond to his words on Feb 10, (the anniversary of revolution) and will show their stance against such threats.&quot;
