Governor Patrick Khaemba has urged residents to bury their loved ones in public cemeteries instead of burying them on variable land. The governor, alarmed by fragmentation of agriculture land for settlement, said it is uneconomical for residents to line up graves on land critical for agricultural purposes. He was speaking during the commissioning of a multi-million seed processing plant and research centre constructed by SeedCo Kenya in Kiminini. &ldquo;My concern is the fragmentation of agricultural land for settlement. Let our departed relatives rest in peace at the cemeteries instead of parading graves on land that could be utilised for agriculture,&rdquo; he said. -Osinde Obare
