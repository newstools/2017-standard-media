Moyale MP Roba Duba&#39;s vehicle killed three people at the weekend when it collided with a motorcycle. The accident occurred in Marua on the Nyeri-Nanyuki highway. Two passengers on the motorcycle died on the spot while the rider succumbed while receiving treatment at Tumutumu Mission Hospital. The MP was on his way to Nairobi in the company of his driver and two bodyguards. However, none of them suffered any significant injuries in the grisly road accident. Duba&#39;s bodyguards had to whisk him away to prevent an angry mob of boda boda operators, which had gathered at the scene, from lynching the vehicle&#39;s occupants.
