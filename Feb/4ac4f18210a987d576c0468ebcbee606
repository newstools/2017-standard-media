Police Sunday barred Governor Mwangi wa Iria&#39;s convoy from passing through Kabati market in efforts to prevent a clash between his and Kigumo MP Jamleck Kamau&#39;s supporters. Responding to orders from Kandara OCPD Gregory Mutiso, police detained vehicles mounted with public address systems in Mr Iria&#39;s and gubernatorial aspirant Moses Mwangi&#39;s convoys as they headed for the same destination. The vehicles were taken to Kabati Police Station. Mr Kamau had notified the police that he would be in Kagundu-ini and Gaichinjiru after a Sunday church service and was allowed to conduct his meetings. County Commissioner John Elungata had directed politicians wishing to hold campaigns to notify the police to avert any clashes between rival supporters. An angry Iria camped at the police station demanding the immediate release of the trucks. He accused the police of being used to humiliate him. &quot;The police had been notified that the MP was in the area and the two others (Iria and Mwangi) had to be blocked from proceeding to avert possible chaos as has been previously witnessed in Muruka,&quot; said Mr Mutiso. Iria&#39;s aides accused the police of being used to sabotage their campaigns, saying they would adopt a new strategy to beat the &quot;unreasonable&quot; terms. Mr Kamau was in Gaichanjiru Catholic Church before he visited patients in Gaichanjiru Mission Hospital, where he paid medical bills for two patients. On Friday, the governor claimed Kamau, Senate Deputy Speaker Kembi Gitura and Deputy Governor Gakure Monyo were using public forums to portray him as a person who has stolen public resources.
