Our education sector is being reformed. Last year, every effort was put in place to ensure the credibility of national examinations, which had been heavily eroded over the years. For long, exam cheating was the norm, rather than the exception. The quality of students making the cut to university has also been a subject of concern. The general feeling has been that they are not competent enough even after going through university. Consequently, there have been efforts to review the education curriculum to align it with our national aspirations and growing trends across the globe. Our universities have become citadels of corruption where those who don&rsquo;t merit degrees end up buying them. The focus is now on restoring our lost glory in the field of education; for long, the best in the region. The University of Nairobi continues to hold the pride of place in rankings in the region. Global ranking institution Webometrics places UoN at position 8 in Africa, 1 in East Africa and 775 globally from 24,000 institutions ranked. This is no mean achievement and we should be proud of it. Greater effort is called for to enable UoN and indeed, other Kenyan universities to dislodge South Africa&rsquo;s University of Cape Town from the highest perch in Africa. It can be done. &nbsp; ALSO READ: Matiang'i tightens rules on varsity graduations
