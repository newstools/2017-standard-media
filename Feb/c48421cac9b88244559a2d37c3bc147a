The Rwandan government plans next week to sell its 20 percent stake in I&amp;M Bank operations in Rwanda, with the aim of raising 11.5 billion francs ($14.1 million), a minister and a senior executive said. The initial public offering (IPO) would be launched on Feb. 14 and the proceeds would be used to help finance a new airport at Bugesera, east of the capital Kigali, the officials said. &quot;The money will be invested as initial equity in the Bugesera Airport,&rdquo; Rwandan Finance Minister Claver Gatete told parliament, saying the aim was to raise 11.5 billion francs. Robin Bairstow, managing director of I&amp;M Bank in Rwanda, told Reuters the IPO launch date was Feb. 14. I&amp;M Bank in Rwanda is part of the Kenyan group I&amp;M Holdings . The listing would boost the Rwandan bourse, where the total market capitalisation of the seven listed firms rose to $4.1 billion in 2015 but has since fallen to $3.4 billion.
