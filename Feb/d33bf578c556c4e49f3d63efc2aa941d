Burglars have stolen 46 tablets and one laptop at Mosobecho Primary School. The school was among the institutions in Nandi County that benefited in the first phase of the laptop programme in November 2016. &quot;The thieves broke into the strongroom where the gadgets were kept and made away with them on Saturday night. &quot;They also broke into the staff room and head teacher&#39;s office,&quot; said head teacher John Keino. Only one laptop remained because the head teacher had taken it home for the weekend. Distraught pupils spent the entire Sunday combing through tea plantations near the school in a desperate hope of recovering the stolen gadgets. Nandi Central Deputy County Commissioner George Matundura confirmed the Saturday night raid. &quot;Footprints led us to a short-cut through the school fence near the main road where the thieves seemed to have parked a vehicle that was suspected to have been used to ferry the gadgets,&quot; said Mr Matundura. The head teacher said he received a call from the watchman on the night of the incident that the school had been broken into. Keino added that the watchman admitted he was not in the school compound when the incident took place. Matundura said police had launched investigations into the theft and appealed to residents to provide information that may lead to the arrest of suspects. The school watchman has been arrested for questioning. Matundura advised schools to be vigilant, saying thieves took advantage of the security lapse to steal the gadgets. The head teacher called on the Government to increase funding for construction of secure rooms for electronic equipment.
