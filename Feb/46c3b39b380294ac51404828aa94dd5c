The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) on Monday suffered a setback in its preparation for the August 8, 2017 general election after the High Court nullified a Sh2.5 billion contract for ballot papers. Justice George Odunga ruled that the contract awarded to Al Ghuraiar Printing and Publishing Company for supply and delivery of ballot papers, election results declaration forms and poll registers was illegal and riddled with suspicion. &quot;The commission cannot be allowed to hide under the pretext of public interest and time constraints in preparing for the elections to engage in acts of illegality. Any public interest that is contrary to the constitution cannot be allowed to stand otherwise we would be abdicating our duty,&quot; ruled Odunga. He directed IEBC to restart the tender process for ballot papers within the next seven days.
