Jubilee leaders have asked Cord&nbsp;to stop protecting drug warlords within their midst during ba meeting at the coast. The leaders were the National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale, Kwale Governor Salim Mvurya, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko , MPs Gideon Mungaro (Kilifi North), Mustapha Idd (Kilifi South) and Khatib Mwashetani (Lunga Lunga). Speaking at a public rally at Changamwe grounds in Mombasa County attended by Deputy President William Ruto, the leaders said some Opposition leaders were benefitting from the proceeds of the world drug trade, which was ruining the lives of young Kenyans. &nbsp;&ldquo;Opposition leaders should come out clearly over the drug business and stop protecting those behind the menace simply because they happen to come from their political outfit,&rdquo; said Duale. &nbsp;He added that the Government was serious about the fight against drugs and challenged Opposition leader Raila Odinga to speak up about the menace. &nbsp;Ruto said investigations were being carried out to establish more people who were still engaging in the illegal business so that they can face justice. The extradition of the Akasha brothers was the beginning of collaboration between Kenya and other countries to stop drug trafficking lords.

Ruto urged voters in Coast not to be misled by individuals with selfish agenda to support leaders who have no development agenda for Kenya. &nbsp;&ldquo;Kenyans will now choose between those who have agenda for this country and those who only want to share seats among themselves at the expense of serving them,&rdquo; he added.
