Mandera: Gunmen believed to be Al-Shabaab terrorists attacked a police post and destroyed communication masts in Arabia area, Mandera County. This cut communication between police officers who were at the Administration Police post and other commanders. It was not immediately clear if there were casualties following the early morning incident. North Eastern regional commander Mohamud Saleh said they had sent a response team to check on the casualties. &ldquo;There is no communication with officers on the ground but there was an attack there. Teams are heading there,&rdquo; he said. Police say there has been no communication with the officers who were at the post which is about 100 kilometres away from Mandera town and hence a team has been dispatched to establish what happened.
