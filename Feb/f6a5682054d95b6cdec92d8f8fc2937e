The Kajiado race for governor seems to have taken a different turn after five aspirants allied to Jubilee Party failed to agree on whom to front. The five aspirants, Taraiya ole Kores, George King&#39;ori, Moses Parantai, Daniel Nina alias Livondo and former Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph ole Lenku have decided to seek the party nomination instead of consensus as earlier planned. This follows failed efforts by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto to bring the aspirants together.
