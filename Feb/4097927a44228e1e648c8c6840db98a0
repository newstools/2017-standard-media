ODM has declared it will field a candidate against former Deputy Speaker Farah Maalim for Garissa Township parliamentary seat. ODM leader Raila Odinga introduced Nasir Dolal alias Jofle, who narrowly lost to Aden Duale, as the party candidate. Maalim recently defected from Raila Odinga&#39;s ODM to Kalonzo Musyoka&#39;s Wiper party. Although National Super Alliance (NASA) leaders have shown unity in Nairobi and at other high profile meetings, the same was not the case when Raila held a rally in Garissa last week. Prominent leaders allied to Wiper party from the county were conspicuously absent from the rally. Among those who did not show up was Maalim, who is considered to be NASA&#39;s top point man by virtue of his position as the deputy party leader and Shukran Gure the Garissa County woman rep.
