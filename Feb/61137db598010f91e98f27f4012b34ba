More than 600,000 civil servants are set to enjoy a salary increase from July. This comes as the Public Service ministry said it would sign a collective bargaining agreement with the Union of Kenya Civil Servants as a commitment to implement harmonised public service salaries recommended by the Salaries and Remuneration Commission (SRC). Under the new structure, the lowest-paid worker will earn Sh14,442 and the highest Sh292,765 per month.
