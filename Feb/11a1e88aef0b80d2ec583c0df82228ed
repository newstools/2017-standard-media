I appreciate that this is a political season, but this does not preclude rational thinking and adopt a see nothing, hear nothing and say nothing position and claim that my government has achieved zero. The Nairobi City County has achieved a lot despite the fact that national government owes the county Sh69.5 billion in rates, parking fees among others. As a county, we collect Sh23 billion per annum, out of which about Sh15 billion goes to salaries and the rest to development projects. The huge workforce at the county is due to the extra 11,000 employees inherited from the defunct City Council, 3,500 from national government and 500 from Transition Authority. In the last four years my administration has covered several grounds and I will be seeking a second term to not only complete the unfinished projects but also fully realise my vision for Nairobi as per my strategic plan. We have done six new 10km roads. Work on 50km of roads in several parts of the city is going on.

My administration has installed 25,000 streetlights in the past three years. We have constructed 120-bed maternity wing at Mbagathi Hospital in 2014, constructed 112 body capacity mortuary at the same hospital thereby reducing congestion at City mortuary. We have also built 172 classrooms in over 20 schools. Dr Evans Kidero, Nairobi governor
