Labour Party leader Ababu Namwamba has kept supporters in the dark about plans for the August 8 polls. Speaking in Nakuru County yesterday after a two-day retreat for party officials, Mr Namwamba said party leaders were not under any pressure to declare which presidential candidate or coalition they will support. Namwamba, who fell out with ODM leader Raila Odinga over the management of the Orange party, said the party currently enjoys and values its independence and is ready to face the election with confidence. &quot;The issue of presidential race is being deliberated and a decision on the party&#39;s position will be communicated in the near future,&quot; said the Budalang&#39;i MP. He said Labour Party has internal capacity to consider any issue and top officials have commenced healthy consultations. Namwamba, who was accompanied by National Chairman Julia Ojiambo and Secretary General David Makali, cautioned the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission against giving life to controversies raised by Jubilee and NASA leaders.
