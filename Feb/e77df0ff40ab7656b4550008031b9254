Kenya must evaluate its relationship with its neighbours following the African Union Commission elections loss, a Cabinet secretary has said. Speaking at a luncheon organised by women leaders in Nairobi yesterday, Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Amina Mohamed said Kenya&#39;s relationship with its neighbours was important because it affected Kenyan lives daily. &quot;We have learned a great lesson. However, this is not going to affect the relationship we have with them. We need to get that right.&quot; Reports indicated that South Sudan voted for Kenya but during the final stages, Uganda, Burundi, Djibouti and Tanzania did not. Kenya was accused of failing to convince its closest allies from East Africa to vote for Amina. &quot;We began campaigns two and a half months ago and we had a great team that reached out to 52 countries. We had a wonderful campaign; we have not lost anything. Instead, we have gained a lot and made new friends,&quot; she said.

That was a decision made by heads of state. We want a strong African Union that can make decisions in support of our economic, ICT and youth agenda among others. We have so much to do in our country and continent.&quot; Although she declared her support for Chad Foreign Affairs minister Moussa Faki Mahamat, who won the election, Amina said the new leader had a &quot;big responsibility to unite the continent because it is divided&quot;. &quot;We want a new Africa that is growing. The focus of the AU is to ensure that peace and security prevails.&quot; Earlier, she had said the fact that 16 countries abstained was a clear manifestation of Africa&#39;s division.
