A former deputy solicitor-general has defended the Government&rsquo;s decision to sign the multi-billion-shilling Anglo Leasing contracts. Dorcas Achapa testified that after going through the contract documents between the Government and Sound Day Limited, she was convinced there was no conspiracy, sinister motive or anything unusual that would have made the office of the Attorney General to stop the contract. &ldquo;There was nothing unusual in the Anglo Leasing contracts. I went through the contract documents and it was my legal opinion that it was good. The AG also gave his legal opinion which validated the contract and any action taken to pay was within the law,&rdquo; said Achapa, who at the time of the controversial contract in 2003 was the deputy solicitor-general at the AG&rsquo;s chambers. She said that there was nothing wrong in the Government paying three per cent commitment fees to the companies as the law required they do so before the contract is executed. She added that she had previously dealt with other contracts for police projects, and that the Anglo Leasing project to modernise police operations was not different.

We found there was nothing wrong on special authorisation given to the Permanent Secretary in charge of Finance to sign the documents on behalf of the minister,&rdquo; said Achapa.
