The Aga Khan University Graduate School of Media and Communications (AKU GSMC) has stepped up efforts to transform leadership in Africa. The institution signed an agreement this week with the Aga Khan Foundation and the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, Executive Education, to introduce two courses designed to equip executives with the skills, mindset and communication expertise to better lead their organisations. AKU GMSC will host the two courses under the banner of &lsquo;Transforming Leadership for 21st Century Africa&rsquo;, and will target officials from the Government, private sector, civil society and media. The Harvard Kennedy School Executive Education will deliver a course titled &lsquo;Adaptive Leadership for Africa: Chaos Complexity and Courage&rsquo;, aimed at helping executives exercise leadership amid uncertainty with skill, purpose and effectiveness. The second course, &lsquo;The Voice of Leadership: Inspiration, Influence and Impact&rsquo;, will be delivered by AKU GSMC to empower leaders to speak and act with clarity of vision and authenticity. &ldquo;We are proud to bring to Nairobi an extraordinary opportunity for African executives to sharpen two of the most vital skills needed to better lead their organisations &ndash; and Africa itself &ndash; in our increasingly complex and rapidly changing world,&rdquo; said AKU GSMC Founding Dean Michael Meyer. The institution will launch the courses in November. &ldquo;For us at Harvard Kennedy School Executive Education, this engagement stresses our commitment to public service and to engaging senior leaders in Africa. We are pleased to bring our adaptive leadership curriculum to the region,&rdquo; said Senior Associate Dean Debra Iles.
