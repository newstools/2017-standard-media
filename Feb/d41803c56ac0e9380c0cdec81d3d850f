Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi has dispelled any fears of being back stabbed in the National Super Alliance (NASA) outfit. Musalia said he has gained enough experience on political coalitions. He further emphasised that he was in NASA to stay saying their main focus is to remove Jubilee from power and return Kenya to sanity. &ldquo;That is why I embarked on the NASA journey even as I was ridiculed and laughed off,&rdquo; he said, adding that NASA was offering trust as a value in leadership whereas Jubilee government has thrived on deceit.
