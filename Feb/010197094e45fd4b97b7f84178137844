Jubilee and Opposition leaders in Kakamega County are blaming each other for the low turn-out in the ongoing voter registration exercise. ODM&#39;s Wycliffe Oparanya &nbsp;accused Jubilee MPs of failing to mobilise locals to register as voters as the Government-allied legislators faulted the Opposition for allegedly shunning the exercise. &quot;Jubilee leaders in the county are not aggressive,&quot; Mr Oparanya said.
