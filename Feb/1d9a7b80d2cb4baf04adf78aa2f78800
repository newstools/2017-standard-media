Franklin&nbsp;Roosevelt, the 32nd President of the United States, once said that democracy cannot succeed unless those who express their choice are prepared to choose wisely. And 100-year-old Phylis Nyokabi Kamau put these wise words into perspective yesterday when she registered as a voter. Her son James Ng&#39;ethe, who accompanied her, said for the past four days, she had been requesting to be taken to a polling station to exercise her right.
