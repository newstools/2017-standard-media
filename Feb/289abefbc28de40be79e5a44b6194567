First Lady Margaret Kenyatta has cancelled this year&rsquo;s Half Marathon, saying she will not politicise the Beyond Zero agenda. In a press statement, the First Lady appreciated Kenyans, partners and other stakeholders for supporting the Half Marathon for the last four years in an attempt to end maternal and child mortality across the country. &ldquo;Over the last four years, we have worked together&mdash;we have run together bonded by our shared conviction that no mother should die while giving life and that every child should live to see their 5th birthday.&rdquo; The First Lady Half Marathon has made several achievements including purchasing 47 fully equipped mobile clinics delivered to every single County in Kenya. This year, I was looking forward to running yet another marathon - a Gratitude Marathon. &ldquo;I was preparing to celebrate with Kenyans to say thank you for running with me and for supporting Beyond Zero. You have all made a huge difference to the lives of thousands of women, men and children, in our great nation.&rdquo;&nbsp; &nbsp;&ldquo;However, I have never been willing to politicize this agenda. As a consequence I feel it necessary to cancel the First Lady&rsquo;s Half Marathon this year.&rdquo; The First Lady however says she is committed to and will not deviate from her ultimate goal, which is the betterment of maternal healthcare in the country, and, to build the Beyond Zero Referral Hospital.
