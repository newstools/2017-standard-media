An elections lobby group has asked the Independent Electoral and Boundary (IEBC) not to extend the mass voter registration exercise, which ends on Tuesday. The Election Observation Group (ELOG) yesterday said the IEBC needs time to handle other election-related issues, among them registration of diaspora voters and cleaning of the register. &ldquo;The timelines were clearly set out. We would not recommend for an extension as it may compromise on other activities,&rdquo; said ELOG Chair Regina Opondo. She blamed politicians for apathy among the young people. &ldquo;The youth seem to have no confidence in this government as they feel left out in the last five years and at the same they feel the Opposition has not offered anything tangible for them,&rdquo; said Opondo. Data from the IEBC shows that with just three days to the deadline, only 2.1 million people out of the 6 million target have been registered.
