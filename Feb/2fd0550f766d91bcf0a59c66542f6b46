(photo:robert kiplagat/standard) Jubilee Party has suffered a setback after Narok West MP Patrick Ntutu quit to join Chama Cha Mashinani (CCM). Ntutu, who was elected on Deputy President&rsquo;s United Republican Party, has cited JP unfairness ahead of April primaries. The outspoken legislator had petitioned the Jubilee Secretariat over the disputed interim county officials&rsquo; elections held last December where his rival Governor Samuel Tunai&rsquo;s side carried the day. He had issued a 14-day ultimatum to resolve the dispute, which he claimed was unfair, failure to which he would quit. He has since declared interest in the governor&rsquo;s seat.

I have already quit Jubilee to join Ng&rsquo;eno and Governor Isaac Ruto to form our party that is expected field parliamentary candidates and elect new Narok Governor,&rdquo; said Ntutu.
