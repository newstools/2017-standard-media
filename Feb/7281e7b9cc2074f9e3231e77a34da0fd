Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi has said the Opposition will go to a referendum after the elections to create new leadership positions. In the meantime, he said, the National Super Alliance (NASA) co-principals will share out positions currently anchored in the Constitution. NASA is made up of Mudavadi&#39;s ANC, the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) member parties of Orange Democratic Movement (ODM), Wiper and Ford Kenya, as well as 15 smaller parties. The newly-formed alliance is grappling with forging a formula that will enable its leaders to win the elections. A 12-member technical committee led by economist David Ndii has already put up structures for NASA and modalities for picking a presidential flag-bearer are in high gear. &quot;From next week, we will be communicating many of our plans to you. But as it appears now, we will go to the polls on existing positions. It is impossible now to effect a referendum to create other positions,&quot; Mudavadi said when he addressed women aspirants for various political seats from across the country.
