Some 30 elected leaders who were last year ordered not to defend their seats have vowed to defy the directive.In the intra-clan power-sharing deal announced by Garre elders in August last year, almost all elected leaders in the county were told not to contest any seats in the August 8 elections. The barred leaders include Senator Billow Kerrow, Governor Ali Roba, MPs Mohamed Huka (Mandera South), Mohamed Abdi Haji (Banissa), Mohamud Mohamed (Mandera West) and Aden Mohamed Noor (Mandera North), Woman Representative Fathia Mahbub and 18 elected MCAs.Addressing a rally at Moi stadium in Mandera yesterday, the leaders dismissed the elders&#39; declaration, saying they would&nbsp; defend their respective seats.On the other hand, the council of elders has presented names of candidates who should vie for the positions. They include former Rift Valley Provincial Commissioner Hassan Noor, who has been given the go-ahead to contest the governorship.
