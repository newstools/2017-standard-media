Parliament has approved the nomination of retired Anglican Archbishop Eliud Wabukala as the new anti-corruption agency boss.MPs yesterday unanimously supported Wabukala&#39;s nomination as the new chairperson of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC), with the lawmakers exuding confidence he will slay the graft dragon. Majority Leader Aden Duale and his Minority counterpart Francis Nyenze led the House in endorsing the former Anglican Church leader, cautioning him that the fight against corruption will not be a walk in the park.&quot;I wish the retired archbishop the very best. Where he is going is not the Anglican Church, neither is it a religious activity. He is walking to a dangerous institution called the EACC, where corruption fights back,&quot; warned the Garissa Township legislator.Duale noted during the two terms he has served as an MP, he had participated in selecting three of Kenya&#39;s five anti-corruption czars, saying he hopes Wabukala will deliver.
