The number of malnourished children in the country could double in the coming days due to the ongoing drought.According to the Ministry of Health, five per cent of children in the country are already faced with wasting because of living under hard circumstances like drought.And as the prolonged harsh weather continues to wreak havoc, the ministry has called for urgent measures to address malnutrition. According to the ministry&#39;s head of Nutrition and Dietetics, Gladys Mugambi, the drought has eroded gains made in the health sector.She noted that according to the Kenya Demographic Survey, only five per cent of minors in the country were suffering from wasting; another 11 per cent were underweight.&quot;In some counties such as Kitui and West Pokot, cases of underweight children stand at 40 per cent and with the ongoing drought, things could get worse,&quot; she said.
