Kenyan Al Shabaab operatives based in Somalia, among them Ahmed Iman Ali aka Abu Zinira, senior Al Shabaab leader in charge of media propaganda Erick Achayo Ogada aka Ibrahim Ogada and Kennedy Yogan Mwok aka Anwar, have been getting their remittances from stalls they own in Gikomba market.However, following sustained Government operations inhibiting financing from Majengo and Gikomba stalls, some Kenyan terror operatives based in Somalia are now using their families and relatives as conduits of money transfer to Somalia, police said.&quot;Police have also been following up on their associates and investigations reveal the group based in Somalia has revived old networks by relying on financial facilitation from their relatives in Kenya,&quot; said a police officer pursuing the matter.

Dorcas, who is also a Kenyan Al Shabaab operative based in Somalia, is the wife of Anwar.Some of the money is sent to individuals within Ifo refugee camp or Eastleigh, which is later sent to Somalia.&quot;This has enabled Ogada to stay comfortably in Somalia while engaging in recruitment of Kenyans to join Al Shabaab and planning attacks against innocent civilians.&quot;Another man on the radar allegedly operates an electronics shop in Kitui village (Kinyago Gwang&#39;a) behind Biafra Mosque.Previously, he used to operate an electronics shop at the junction between Lamu and Digo road in Majengo but later moved to Gwang&#39;a. He is also a clothes trader in Gikomba market.A team has since been formed to track all the properties owned by terrorists&#39; kin in Kenya.
