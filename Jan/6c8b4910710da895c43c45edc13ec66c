Former Gatanga MP Peter Kenneth Sunday formally announced his candidature for the Nairobi governor&#39;s seat.The announcement sets the stage for a bruising battle for the city&#39;s Jubilee ticket for the August 8 elections. Mr Kenneth said he was ready to face his opponents for the ticket that has also attracted Dagoretti South MP Dennis Waweru, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, nominated MP Johnson Sakaja and former Starehe lawmaker Margaret Wanjiru.Speaking at Jesus Winner Church in Roysambu, Nairobi, Kenneth asked Nairobi residents to vote for him, describing himself as a &#39;manager&#39; capable of tackling some of the city&#39;s runaway problems such as uncollected garbage, unending traffic snarl-ups and poor service delivery.He also asked Nairobi voters to register in huge numbers to ensure the ruling party captures the governor&#39;s seat currently in the hands of the Opposition.

Nairobi with its diversity requires a manager. Services can only be provided by a manager with a proven track record. I can assure you that if Nairobi is seriously looking for a good manager, you don&#39;t need to look anywhere else,&quot; Kenneth told the congregation at Jesus Winner Ministry, Nairobi.During the Sunday service, seven Jubilee lawmakers drawn from across the city&#39;s constituencies threw their weight behind the former Gatanga MP, observing that he stands the best chance of dethroning&nbsp; incumbent Governor Evans Kidero.The lawmakers cited Kenneth&#39;s past development record as evidence of his managerial and leadership skills, and urged Nairobi residents to back him for the seat.Those who backed Kenneth&#39;s entry into the gubernatorial race included Maina Kamanda (Starehe), Rachel Shebesh (Nairobi), George Theuri (Embakasi West), James Gakuya (Embakasi North), John Ndirangu (Embakasi Central), Yusuf Hassan (Kamukunji) and John Njoroge (Kasarani).Nominated Senator Beatrice Elachi, who is gunning for Dagoretti North parliamentary seat, also supported Mr Kenneth.However, Mr Kamanda warned against dividing the Jubilee Party vote in the city.
