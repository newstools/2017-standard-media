They&#39;re about to lose power,&quot; said John Workman, a former mayor of Palm Beach Shores, Florida, as a pair of costumed robots danced to &quot;Sweet Home Alabama.&quot;Ironically, Workman and other Trump supporters were participating in a Washington ritual as old as the city itself - the crush of balls, parties and protests that mark the inauguration of a new U.S. president.Trump takes office after a bitter presidential campaign marked by allegations of sexual harassment, race baiting and foreign hacking, and some of the parties were apparently as divisive as the president-elect himself.

The Garden State party had to scramble for entertainment after a Bruce Springsteen tribute band canceled on the New Jersey-themed event, saying the artist whose songs they played would not approve.That didn&#39;t seem to phase Trump, who made an appearance at a candlelight dinner for donors in Union Station, promising &quot;four incredible years&quot; and bragging about his surprise November victory.

A Trump supporter, she bought tickets before the Nov. 8 election.Held at the Fairmont Hotel, which recently completed a $27 million renovation, the party featured a giant Teddy Roosevelt mascot, celebrity host Joe Piscopo, and political figures from both parties.Several Republicans at the ball confided that they were not in town to celebrate Trump&#39;s victory as much as they were to celebrate the end of Democratic President Barack Obama&#39;s term, and, above all, have a good time.To some partygoers, the soiree lacked a certain energy.&quot;If Trump were here he would be disappointed with the lack of ladies on the dance floor,&quot; said James Koutoulas, a tuxedo-clad hedge fund owner from Florida, as he nursed a vodka tonic.
