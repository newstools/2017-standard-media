CAPE TOWN: U.S. auto-maker Ford will recall 4,500 Kuga SUVs sold in South Africa after dozens of reports of the vehicles catching fire spontaneously, the head of the company&#39;s South Africa unit said on Monday.In a joint statement with the National Consumer Commission (NCC), Ford&#39;s Southern Africa President and chief executive Jeff Nemeth said the company could confirm 39 incidents of the cars catching fire. &quot;We are not aware of any injuries that have resulted from our engine compartment fires,&quot; Nemeth told a media briefing.He said early investigations revealed that fires in the Kuga 1.6 litre model, imported from Spain, were likely due to overheating caused by a lack of coolant circulation which could lead to a crack in the cylinder head and oil leaks.If oil reached a hot engine component it could catch fire, Nemeth said. Ford officials said at the briefing that hot weather in South Africa could be a contributing factor.
