Deputy President William Ruto and Opposition leader Raila Odinga have clashed over battle for Nairobi top seat, which they have signalled has the highest stakes for them outside the Presidency.Raila yesterday met Orange Democratic Movement&rsquo;s Nairobi leaders to strategise how to fend off Jubilee&rsquo;s onslaught to seize control of the management of the capital city, as he mocked Ruto over his declaration the ruling coalition was determined to dislodge Governor Evans Kidero. &ldquo;I have heard Ruto say that they will do anything to capture the governor&rsquo;s seat. I want to tell him that he has never been an elected leader in Nairobi and cannot purport to control Nairobi politics,&rdquo; charged Raila. He was referring to Ruto&rsquo;s statement following a meeting last Wednesday at which he rallied Jubilee aspirants warring for the seat to select a sole candidate by consensus.Raila added: &ldquo;Yeye ni jogoo wa shamba ambaye hawiki mjini (he is a village cockerel that cannot crow in the city).&rdquo;The ODM leaders stressed Nairobi was an important political constituency that the Opposition must do everything possible to gain control of.

We also got more votes in the gubernatorial contest than the Jubilee candidate. How come we lost Senate, woman representative and National Assembly seats?&rdquo; he asked.&nbsp;Raila, who will be making a fourth stab at the presidency should the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy pick him as the flag bearer, said there were constituencies in the city that they lost to Jubilee because they lacked the wisdom and intellect to choose a better strategy.UNDER CRITICISMIn particular, he singled out Roysambu, Kasarani, Makadara and Embakasi West as areas where his Orange party could have won easily but lost because of selfishness and greed.Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero came under heavy criticism from aspirants and sitting elected leaders for failing to be &lsquo;felt&rsquo; on the ground.Speaker after speaker told the governor to his face that if he did not change his strategy, he would lose the in forthcoming elections.

However, Sakaja allayed fears that the bitter contest would split the team, terming the fight for the ticket a healthy one.The lawmaker promised party supporters that they would eventually present one candidate who would be supported by all other leaders.&ldquo;This is a healthy competition, no matter how vicious it may appear to be. I can assure you that there will be no split. It is not about an individual but the best interests for Nairobi,&rdquo; said Sakaja.He further argued that the contest would help mop up Jubilee votes to the advantage of the President as each camp would be working to ensure that many people registered as Jubilee members for the purpose of nominations and eventually the August polls.Mr Kamanda played down the alleged scheme against Kenneth, which first came to the fore last Friday after the former Gatanga legislator missed the Jubilee event at Kasarani, where the four exhibited their unity.He revealed that Kenneth only missed the Kasarani meeting because he was attending the burial of a family member.&ldquo;Peter Kenneth is very much part of the talks and as far as I am concerned there is no scheme against anyone. These are negotiations and before you agree on one candidate, you are bound to have differing opinions,&rdquo; Kamanda said.
