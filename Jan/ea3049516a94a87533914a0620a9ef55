The Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) has opened the first regional sub-Saharan Africa office at Nivina Towers on Westlands Road, Nairobi, to coordinate its operations. The office will be headed by Wafula Nabutola, RICS&rsquo;s sub-Saharan Africa regional director. Speaking during the function last week, the institution&rsquo;s regional managing director of Europe, Middle East and Africa Mark Walley said: &ldquo;It shows our confidence in Africa, investors&rsquo; direction into Africa and the need for raising the standards of professional services in the real estate and built environment,&rdquo; said Walley.
