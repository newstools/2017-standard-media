The electoral agency has suspended the use of the short message service (SMS) to verify whether one is a registered voter.&quot;We realised it was hectic for us to handle the growing number of online inquiries almost each minute, even before we get to upload data,&quot; said Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) Communications Manager Andrew Limo.IEBC noted many people were disappointed with the SMS system as it took too long to get feedback. &quot;It is the reason why after prolonged executive discussions, we decided to suspend the SMS service,&quot; he said. IEBC said they will consolidate and make the register available for verification via SMS and online. Opposition leader Raila Odinga was unhappy over the agency&#39;s move.&nbsp;
