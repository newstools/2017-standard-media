The row between Hassan Ali Joho and the national government over withdrawal of his security took a new twist Thursday as some officers claimed they had been thrown out of the governor&rsquo;s Nyali home.Mr Joho returned to Mombasa last evening and declared that he would not be intimidated by the Jubilee administration. There was confusion regarding five Administration Police officers deployed at a house alleged to be the governor&rsquo;s, but Joho claimed he no longer lives there.The officers, who had been ordered to guard the home by their bosses in Nyali, claimed they were ejected from the residence. Yesterday, Government spokesman Erick Kiraithe said the State would not impose guards on Joho if he does not want them.

To make matters worse, their superiors had ordered them not to return to their base.Meanwhile, some officers who refused to speak on record showed this writer pictures taken inside the home, saying they were ejected by Joho&rsquo;s relatives on Tuesday. They neither explained why they took the pictures nor why they could not return to their base. &ldquo;They have been sleeping outside here. They say the orders from Joho were passed to them through his brother on Tuesday,&rdquo; said a private guard at a house near Joho&rsquo;s.Although the officers could not address the media as they are not allowed to do do, the private guard on Tuesday said a standoff ensued between the AP officers and inspectorate officers after they (police) were ordered to leave the compound.Joho&rsquo;s spokesman Richard Chacha said he was not aware of the new development, and promised to seek clarification from the governor over reports that he does not need State protection.Mr Chacha said the APs had been deployed to the governor&rsquo;s former residence &ldquo;where the governor no longer lives and we wonder why they cannot return to their station if they claim they have been rejected&rdquo;.Last evening, Joho said he no longer lives in the house where the officers were deployed and wondered why the &ldquo;State is insisting on keeping them there&rdquo;.&ldquo;In any case I have made it clear I do not need them because I want to end this debate about guards.&rdquo; ALSO READ: Give governors securityDuring the Opposition&rsquo;s meeting at Bomas of Kenya on Wednesday, Joho said he does not need State protection and the new police assigned to him should be recalled.Yesterday, Mr Kiraithe said many VIPs in the country have in the past turned down State security and they cannot be forced on them.&ldquo;We have VIPs who despite intel that indicate that they need extra protection still turn down advice from the police. It is not new. Even the President has in some instances ordered his security personnel to be reduced. We do not force people to have State security,&rdquo; he said.He said that it was the discretion or prerogative of the Inspector General of Police to deploy and re-deploy police officers.&ldquo;Joho should not engage Kenyans in political theatrics, especially on an issue which is as clear as whose job it is to deploy and re-deploy police officers,&rdquo; he said.On illegal guns, Kiraithe&nbsp;said County Regional Coordinator Nelson Marwa had not sought assistance or back up from Vigilance House, adding that officers in the county were enough to deal with the issue.&mdash;Additional reporting by Joackim Bwana ALSO READ: China says space program must help protect national security
