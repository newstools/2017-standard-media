Having come to that conclusion, I find that my hands are tied by the law as there is only one sentence mandated by the law for the offence of murder,&quot; Justice Kamau said.She added: &quot;I have no option but hereby sentence the accused person, Wisdom Mwashindo alias Mwanzia to the one sentence that is prescribed by the Penal Code that is to death.&quot;&quot;I have also noted that the accused person was not alone when the heinous act was committed on the deceased and others escaped before being arrested. It is unfortunate that others who participated in the murder have remained scot-free, leaving the accused person to carry his cross and that of others.&quot;The judge was incensed that Mwashindo and his associates had to take away a life because of such a small amount of money.
