Renowned Australian author Brett King predicts many banks are likely to start phasing out teller jobs as they follow customers to digital spaces.Speaking exclusively to The Standard, Mr King - who has given key note addresses on disruptive technology in over 40 countries, graced TED conferences as well as authored Amazon best-selling books on the future of banks - said the next 15 years would see the role of tellers shrink significantly.According to King, as banks become more technology-based to serve the growing demand of customers, they will have to reorganise their structures, leading to job cuts. &quot;As this happens, a lot of old skills we had in banking halls like tellers and credit risk officers can no longer be suitable. There is a 98 per cent chance that bank tellers over the next 15 years will become largely extinct,&quot; he said.His sentiments come at a time when more than seven local banks have declared their intention to lay off workers, citing the realigning of business into the changing realities.King sees a shift to the digital space sounding a death knell for structures such as mortgage, credit card and savings lines to make banking an experience rather than products.

It is going to be cheaper and faster to bring in new staff than retrain unless the Government steps in to fund the retraining,&quot; said King.Retraining may be an expensive option, and larger banks such as Standard Bank in South Africa may choose to take their staff to university. The large capital outlay may not be matched by smaller banks.

For instance, heavily automated firms like Google, Amazon, Facebook and Apple generate about $500,000 (Sh52 million) per employee every year.This compares 10 times better than the best banks in the US such as Chase Bank, Citibank and Bank of America where employees generate only about $50,000 (Sh5.2 million).
