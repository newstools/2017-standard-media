Members of Parliament yesterday approved Bishop Eliud Wabukala&rsquo;s appointment as the new chairman of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC).Wabukala succeeds Peter Kinisu, who left under a cloud following claims he could not adequately fight crime when companies associated with him featured prominently in some of the high-profile corruption cases the EACC was investigating. Indeed, fighting corruption in this country has never been easy. All the anti-corruption chairmen before Wabukala were forced to throw in the towel. All eyes are trained on Wabukala to see whether he will succeed where his predecessors failed. Bishop Wabukala comes on board on a clean slate that he must guard jealously. It will not be a bed of roses because there are many, those that have come to be known as cartels, waiting to trip him at the earliest opportunity.Wabukala must maintain his focus and resolve to succeed where others failed. With the support of Kenyans and political goodwill, that is possible. The Executive and the Judiciary must accord Wabukala their unwavering and genuine support in his efforts to slay the dragon of corruption.If Samson in the Bible survived the lion&rsquo;s den, Wabukala can beat the numerous faceless cartels determined to bring this country down to its knees.
