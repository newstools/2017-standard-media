Meru Governor Peter Munya has urged locals to support Party of National Unity (PNU) which he said offers them alternative leadership ahead of the August General Election.Munya, who is also PNU leader, said: &quot;The region which has millions of voters has never entertained the single-party philosophy and looks at PNU as a liberating outfit.&quot; Munya made the remarks while opening party offices at Kenol, Mukuyu and Gatanga. &quot;It is not a crime for&nbsp; PNU to operate here,&quot; said Munya.
