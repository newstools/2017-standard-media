Kenyans recall that in early 2008, over half a million people were displaced and 1,300 killed in two months of intensive violence that occurred after the announcement of presidential and parliamentary election results.It will be remembered that calls for mass action and demonstrations initiated the fighting, killings and destruction of property.Kenyans will also vividly remember that the year 2008 marked a new beginning when the Kenya National Dialogue and Reconciliation (KNDR) framework came into being. This was made possible through the mediation process, which was mandated by the African Union (AU) and chaired by Koffi Annan as head of the panel of Eminent African Personalities.The main aim was to prevent recurrence of ethnic violence and manage the transition period during its adoption in 2008 and other future elections.The Koffi Annan panel used dialogue to solve the matters. It was realised that in order to achieve long-lasting peace, sustainable development and harmonious co-existence among Kenyans, there was need for deliberate normative, institutional and attitudinal process of construction of nationhood, national cohesion and integration; thus, the NCIC was born.

This is enforced by the reason that young people in school are at an age of experiencing and accessing a lot of information.
