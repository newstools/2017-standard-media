Luo Council of Elders chairman Ker Opiyo Otondi has warned members against endorsing politicians for political seats.Mr Otondi said the growing trend of political endorsements by various elders was tainting the image of the council, which is expected to remain neutral. A number of Nyanza politicians view elders&#39; blessings as a boost to their efforts to win elective positions in the August 8 polls.Speaking at the launch of Kisumu County&#39;s 2017 Sh130 million secondary school scholarship at Tom Mboya Labour College on Tuesday, Otondi asked politicians to keep the elders out of their political activities.&quot;As the Council of Elders, we serve all members of the community and should not be seen to be supporting particular leaders,&quot; said Otondi.
