Nearly a week after nurses ended a month-long strike, services are not yet back to normal in major health facilities.Nurses resumed duties after signing a return-to-work formula with the&nbsp; county government on January 4, after they went on strike on December 1. In the agreement, the employer promised to withdraw interdiction letters that had earlier been issued to 35 nurses and pay accrued salaries.But the nurses returned to find wards deserted as patients kept away from the facilities amidst a paralysing doctors&rsquo; strike.Most public hospitals are still not receiving inpatients and surgical wards have since shut down.
