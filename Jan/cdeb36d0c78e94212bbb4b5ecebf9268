[Photo: Kevin Tunoi/Standard]The mystery over the disappearance of Eldoret lawyer Simon Lilan has deepened after his office was allegedly broken into on Tuesday night.Lilan, who unsuccessfully tried to block the burial of politician Mark Too, has been missing for the last 10 days after claiming his life was in danger following death threats from people opposed to the suit. Family and friends of the missing lawyer, described by close associates as a controversial figure, say they have searched for him in hospitals and morgues but they are yet to trace him.Speaking at the lawyer&#39;s offices Wednesday, his elder brother John Talam said he was shocked to find that the office, located on Nairobi Road and which was always locked, was open prompting him to inform the police.&quot;He has been using the office to meet his clients. The last time he was here, there used to be a laptop and a printer on the table but I did not find anything this morning. The door was partially open,&quot; said Talam.

He has been engaging the public as he seeks to clinch the seat,&quot; his brother said.

I ran to a nearby petrol station to alert my colleagues but on returning, they had disappeared,&quot; he said.On Monday, he said, a gang of five had also visited the premises at around midnight but disappeared after hearing some movements.Officers from the Directorate of Criminal Investigations spent the better part of Wednesday morning piecing together information over the alleged burglary.
