Kabondo-Kasipul legislator Silvance Osele wants the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) compelled to suspend its mass voter registration set to start mid this month. Osele claims there are plans by the polls commission to conduct a skewed voter registration in favour of Jubilee.He says the planned voter listing should be put on hold until IEBC gazettes all polling centres as registration centres for clarity, better monitoring and ease of access. Mr Osele said the polls agency should also explain to stakeholders in detail how it intends to carry out the 30-day voter listing. &nbsp;The commission plans to start the drive on January 16. It will also engage in a seven-day voter education week from today. The country goes to the polls on August 8.
