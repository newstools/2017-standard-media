Leaders from Tran Nzoia and Bungoma counties have dismissed the installation of Amani National Congress party leader Musalia Mudavadi as the Luhya spokesman.Led by Water Cabinet Secretary Eugene Wamalwa and Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka, the leaders hit out at Cotu Secretary General Francis Atwoli for allegedly trying to divide the community. Musalia was unveiled as the Luhya spokesman at Bukhungu Stadium in Kakamega County on Saturday at an event that was given a wide berth by key community leaders including CORD co-principal Moses Wetang&#39;ula.Speaking at a thanksgiving ceremony at Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s home in Sugoi, Uasin Gishu County, Mr Wamalwa termed the move to name Mudavadi as Luhya spokesman inconsequential, noting that it would not eat into the support base of Jubilee Party in the region.&quot;There is nothing new about what happened in Bukhungu Stadium. Jubilee Party is strong and will continue to remain strong in the region,&quot; said Wamalwa.
