President Uhuru Kenyatta has exuded confidence that Jubilee will beat the Opposition coalition hands down in the August 8 General Election.Speaking in Chuka town in Tharaka Nithi County Thursday, Uhuru said the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) was unpopular and had no agenda to better the living standards of Kenyans.He said Jubilee had fulfilled most of its pledges made in 2013 and that was the reason Kenyans were going to re-elect him. Dismissing claims that the 2013 poll was rigged in his favour, Uhuru urged locals to register in large numbers to ensure he beats the Opposition with a bigger margin to remove any doubt.&ldquo;We want leaders who are development-oriented and not dividing Kenyans along tribal lines,&rdquo; he said.Divisive utterances ALSO READ: Why Uhuruto duo cannot be relied onIn a direct reference to CORD co-principal Raila Odinga, the President said his rival had for years been disputing election results, claiming they had been rigged.The Head of State said it was erroneous for the Opposition to claim Jubilee was planning to rig this year&rsquo;s polls since the utterances are likely to divide the people.Kenyans, he said, should not be denied the chance to vote for leaders of their choice.&ldquo;Every time we have elections they claim they have been rigged. In 2007, he claimed Kibaki rigged him and it led to post-election violence. In 2013, he went ahead to claim Jubilee rigged the elections. Now they claim we are planning to rig this year&rsquo;s General Election. Why should I steal someone&rsquo;s votes?&rdquo; posed Uhuru.He was accompanied by Senate Majority Leader and Tharaka Nithi Senator Kithure Kindiki, Nairobi Senator Mike Sonko, MPs Muthomi Njuki (Chuka/Igambang&rsquo;ombe), Beatrice Nkatha (Tharaka Nithi), Alex Muiru (Tharaka), Mithika Linturi (Igembe South) and Kareke Mbiuki (Maara).Meanwhile, President Kenyattta has eased the issuance of IDs and birth certificates to the youth by directing that a letter from a chief is enough to secure the documents.Speaking in Marsabit town Thursday, Uhuru said the rigours that go with the long vetting process for young people to get the papers, that is most notable in northern Kenya and Coast, should now be left to chiefs and their assistants.
