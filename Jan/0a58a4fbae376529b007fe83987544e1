A dispute over a Sh2.3 billion piece of land owned by Uchumi Supermarket could expose it to more financial difficulties.It has emerged that the retail chain used the land as security for some of the loans it is servicing.Through Kasarani Mall Ltd, its land-holding subsidiary, Uchumi is fighting a self-help group that had received orders restraining the retailer from the property. The 20-acre property is next to Thika Road Mall (TRM) in Roysambu along the Thika Superhighway.The fight for the land took a twist last week after the self-help group, Njathaini Electricity Project, was accused of trying to pass its members off as squatters.The 40-year-old retailer argues in court papers that the self-help group misrepresented to the court that it was in active and actual control of the parcel of land.
