Kenya&#39;s reproductive health programmes dependent on donor funding will be among casualties of a policy shift by US President Donald Trump.In a move that could spell disaster for maternal health programmes in Kenya, Trump has reinstated the Mexico City Policy, which prohibits funding for reproductive health programmes.Trump signed the executive order on Monday, also known as the Global Gag Rule, in a move viewed by many as an affront to reproductive health rights as it will deny certain organisations about $600 million (Sh60 billion) annually. Kenya is one of the countries that will face the consequences of this action as both government and non-governmental organisations will lose out on funds to carry out family planning programmes.In Kenya, abortion, which is one of the programmes funded under the policy, remains a very emotive issue that has seen the Ministry of Health refuse to ratify a document on standards, policies and guidelines on abortion as the Constitution notes that abortion is allowed under special circumstances.Echoes of disapproval of Trump&#39;s action have started rising, though the Church in Kenya has been speaking the same language as the leader of the free world, with the Catholic Church being in the forefront.

It creates the impression that Republicans are pro-life while Democrats are pro-choice.&quot;Democrats have been more progressive in health interventions compared to Republicans,&quot; argues Obbuyi.First issued in a memorandum by former US President Ronald Reagan in 1984 at the United Nations Population Conference held in Mexico City, the policy has always been rescinded by Democratic Party presidents only for it to re-instituted when the Republicans takes over.President Reagan served two terms after which George H W Bush took over without making any changes to the policy.

He signed the executive order on January 23, 2009 &ndash; just three days after assuming power.The Mexico City Policy, prohibits NGOs receiving US funds from promoting or providing abortions, as a method of family planning and also prohibits them from advocating for abortion laws in the countries where they operate.Centre for Reproductive Rights Executive Director Evelyn Opondo said in Kenya, not only organisations dealing with planned parenthood will be affected, but also those handling other issues like female genital mutilation.She warned that these agencies might just close shop.
