Former presidential aspirant Peter Kenneth has slammed his rivals in the Jubilee Party race for Nairobi&#39;s governorship for branding him an &quot;outsider&quot;.The former Gatanga MP, who has expressed an interest in the seat, described his rival&#39;s &quot;outsider&quot; tag as &quot;strange&quot;, saying he was born and bred in the city.&quot;The people who are at the forefront of labelling me an outsider have lived in the city for a shorter time than me. I was born and bred in Eastlands, I schooled in Nairobi and have worked here my entire life. I have lived in the city longer than all of them,&quot; he said. Senator Mike Sonko and MPs Dennis Waweru (Dagoretti South), Johnson Sakaja (nominated) and Margaret Wanjiru (formerly Starehe MP) have in the recent past tried to sideline Kenneth in the push and shove for a Jubilee Party nomination ticket for the Nairobi governor&#39;s position.After a church service in Mathioya on Sunday, Sonko, accompanied by Senator Kindiki Kithure (Tharaka Nithi), asked Kenneth to first campaign for President Uhuru Kenyatta, who he opposed in 2013, to prove that he was indeed a Jubilee supporter.During the meeting in Kiria-ini town, Sonko sensationally claimed that Kenneth had offered him Sh1 billion to drop his bid for the city&#39;s top job, claims Kenneth has denied.

Why should people set conditions for me?&quot;
