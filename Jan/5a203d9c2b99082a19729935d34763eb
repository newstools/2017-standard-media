(Photo: AFP)Kampala: A group of Ugandan lawmakers have sent a petition to the International Criminal Court (ICC) to ask for an investigation into possible atrocities by security forces when they clashed with a tribal militia late last year. According to an official toll, 62 people were killed in November when a combined force of soldiers and police officers clashed with a tribal leader&#39;s guards in the Rwenzori region near Uganda&#39;s western border with the Democratic Republic of Congo.William Nzoghu, a legislator from the area and one of six members of parliament who sent the petition, said the number of people killed exceeded 200 and that police and the army &quot;jointly committed genocide and crimes against humanity&quot;.&quot;We are saying let the ICC come and investigate,&quot; he told Reuters late on Wednesday.

It described the killings as extrajudicial.The tribal leader, Charles Wesley Mumbere, was arrested at the time and subsequently charged with treason, murder and other crimes. Scores of his guards were also detained.At a court appearance, some of them - bearing open wounds on visible parts of their bodies - alleged torture by security forces and said they had been denied medical attention.Security officials reject claims that the Rwenzori area is being deliberately destabilised, and instead accuse Mumbere and others in the area of seeking to secede from Uganda.
