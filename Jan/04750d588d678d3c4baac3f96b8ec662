An MP has called on women in Opposition strongholds to withhold sex from men who have not registered as voters.Mombasa woman representative Mishi Mboko yesterday urged women in the country to deny their spouses conjugal rights to force them to go for voter&#39;s cards in readiness for the August 8 elections. Speaking at the Jomo Kenyatta showground at Mkomani in Mombasa where she issued cheques to women and youth self-help groups, Ms Mboko said sex was a powerful weapon to make reluctant men rush to register as voters in the exercise that began yesterday.Mboko&#39;s husband will however be spared of the conjugal boycott, the MP said, as he has already registered as a voter.&quot;Women, this is the strategy you should adopt. It is the best. Deny them sex until they show you their voter&#39;s card,&quot; she said.
