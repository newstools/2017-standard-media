The Government plans to create county licensing committees to help small-scale miners get licences more easily.Mining Cabinet Secretary Dan Kazungu said the ministry has embarked on a four-month exercise to issue artisanal miners with permits in accordance with the new Mining Act. &ldquo;We want to help them have elected representatives to sit in those committees and address their needs. This will ensure that millions of Kenyans who have been blocked from mining are assisted using a fast tracked exercise,&rdquo; said Mr Kazungu at a press briefing in Nairobi on Tuesday.Under the new arrangement, an artisanal mining committee in every county will be made up of eight members chaired by a representative of the area&rsquo;s governor. The secretary will be a representative of the director of mines.Other bodies that will be represented in the committees include Association of Artisanal Miners, the County Lands Board, National Environmental Management Authority and the Inspectorate Division of the Mining Ministry.

There is always someone living on that land or laying claim to the land you want to do mining on,&rdquo; he said.On royalty sharing, CS Kazungu assured host communities that they will get 10 per cent of the benefits while the county government pockets 20 per cent.
