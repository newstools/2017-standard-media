Parliament yesterday approved the seven nominees to the electoral agency.The seven now await the presidential appointment before they can be sworn in as the new&nbsp;Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) commissioners to oversee the August 8 General Election. With just seven months to the election and in the grip of tight time frame, the MPs closed ranks and approved the names.Those approved are Wafula Chebukati (Chairperson), commissioners Consolata Nkatha, Abdi Guliye, Roselyne Kwamboka, Paul Kurgat, Margaret Mwachanya and Boya Molu.The National Assembly Justice and Legal Affairs Committee in its 43-page report found all the nominees suitable to serve.

You should not be intimidated or coerced by any political entity or individual. Let us give this team a fair chance and make sure they will conduct free and fair election. We don&#39;t want Kenyans to quarrel after every five years on who won the election. We want Mr Chebukati to develop a common team work since the life of the 40 million Kenyans will be in his hands. He must be very decisive in whatever decisions he wants to take,&quot; said Mr Duale.Mr Midiwo added: &quot;I support this team, because, we don&#39;t have time as a country. We have very little time left before elections. I want to agree with majority leader that we need to put these people in office as soon as possible so that they can set the rules. It is not that every time we must agree or disagree but there comes a time when logic must prevail.&quot;The nomination of Mr Chebukati had, however, attracted claims that he had been favoured over Tukero Ole Kina who scored higher in the interviews.The in-tray of the new commissioners is full as they assume office seven months to the polls.As the electoral body struggles to restore public confidence after the 2013 presidential poll dispute, it will not be &#39;business as usual&#39; for the Chebukati-led team.
