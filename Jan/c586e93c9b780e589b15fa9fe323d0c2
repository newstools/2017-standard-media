Rising prices for Kenyan tea and coffee exports will help offset the impact from a drought that has been hurting the East African nation&#39;s agriculture after poor rains late last year, according to officials and traders.The average price of coffee rose 30 percent in the fourth quarter of last year from a year earlier, driving up total earnings by 69 percent in the period. The average tea price has risen 10 percent this year compared to a year ago. Farming accounts for more than a quarter of the East African nation&#39;s annual economic output of $62 billion. Coffee and tea exports are a major source of foreign exchange earnings.Richard Lesiyampe, the principal secretary in the Agriculture Ministry, said farmers have been hurt by inadequate rainfall during the usual October to December &quot;short rains&quot;.&quot;Because of the depressed rainfall, definitely we are going to have a challenge on all our crops including the cash crops. The short rains failed us,&quot; he told Reuters.
