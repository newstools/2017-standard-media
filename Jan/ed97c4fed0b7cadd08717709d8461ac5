Kenya&rsquo;s economic growth rate will slow in 2017, from about six per cent last year, due to sluggish credit growth and as investors take a wait-and-see attitude before a presidential election in August, a senior IMF official has said.Armando Morales, the International Monetary Fund&rsquo;s representative in Kenya, said growth is likely to remain within the 5-6 per cent range of the past five years, despite the slowdown. &ldquo;We expect a deceleration of growth for several reasons, but I think the most important reason we are considering is the potential impact of the interest rate cap on credit growth,&rdquo; he told Reuters in an interview. The Government capped commercial lending rates at 400 basis points above the central bank&rsquo;s lending rate last September, hurting already stressed private sector credit growth. After September, banks&rsquo; lending grew by just five per cent year-on-year, down from 17.8 per cent in December 2015. Stricter supervision of banks by the Central Bank and the closure of two mid-sized lenders had cut credit growth before the rate cap came in.
