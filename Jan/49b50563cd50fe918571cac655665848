KISUMU, KENYA: Fishermen in Lake Victoria have expressed concerns over a possible extinction of the Tilapia Species due to high levels of pollution in the lake.They said that a catch on the species has been on a steady decline as various institutions around the lake continue to release untreated waste into the lake.The fishermen in Kisumu and Kendu Bay told the Standard that in the past few months, pollution on the Lake has been on an increase. They noted pollution always threaten the Tilapia species which swims to other regions in search of clean water.John Okello, a fisherman at Dunga beach said that in the recent past, their fishing ventures have resulted in very few Tilapia.He noted that despite the decline in fish stocks in Lake Victoria, Tilapia species has been the most affected with many fishermen now focusing on other species.
