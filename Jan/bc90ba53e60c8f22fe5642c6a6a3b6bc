(Photo: Edward Kiplimo/Standard)Supreme Court Judges are yet to agree on a name to send to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) to represent them. It appears the judges are divided on who to replace Justice Smokin Wanjala, whose term ended last year.To chart a way forward, the Judges have scheduled a retreat in Mombasa next week to discuss and possibly settle the crisis.&ldquo;It is true that we do not have a Supreme Court representative in JSC. This has been so since Justice Wanjala&rsquo;s term ended,&rdquo; said JSC commissioner Tom Ojienda.
