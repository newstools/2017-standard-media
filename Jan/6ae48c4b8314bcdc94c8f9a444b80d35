About 700 descendants of the Nyakinyua dance troupe that used to entertain President Jomo Kenyatta in the &#39;60s and &#39;70s are still living as squatters.Surviving members of the dance troupe that serenaded Kenya&#39;s first president until his sunset years are now accusing successive governments of reneging on a promise to settle them and their families.The elderly artistes - most of them ailing - and their dependents have been living with relatives on Kahorora Farm near Londiani town in Kipkelion East constituency after they were evicted from Shauri village in 1988. The 1,000 acres was located near Londiani Forestry College and Londiani Secondary school.The dancers, who are now too old to make a living from their art, are mobilising their families and sympathisers to boycott the August 8 polls in protest.Rift Valley Council of Elders chairman Gilbert Kabage said it was unacceptable for the ageing and ailing members of the troupe to remain landless despite the first president of the republic instructing the then provincial commissioner, Isaiah Mathenge, to allocate the group land in 1963.
