The Agricultural Society of Kenya (ASK) Mombasa branch elections ended in disarray after a stormy annual general meeting (AGM) at the Mkomani show ground Thursday.Trouble started after ASK Chief Executive Officer Batram Muthoka announced that those who have been members of the ASK for less than three years would not be allowed to take part in the polls.Mr Muthoka was shouted down after he stood his ground. &quot;The election rules have been drafted by members of the council and you should have been conversant with them before you came here for the AGM,&quot; said Muthoka drawing more ire from the audience. Speaker after speaker condemned the move and demanded the controversial rules be scrapped and all members be allowed to vote. They said some of the current officials are opposed to the branch getting new leadership. Kahindi Ngunza, who has been a member for two years, said he was shocked to learn that he was ineligible to vote.&quot;The CEO has no business defining who is allowed and who is not allowed to take part in elections. The constitution that we have is very clear that members regardless of the duration they have been members are allowed to elect officials of their choice,&quot; he charged.Peter Odera another member said the ASK is out to disenfranchise members by coming up with strange technicalities that are not anchored in its constitution.

Former Kenya Ports Authority Chief Executive Officer Brown Ondego successfully took the mantle to serve for two years as the branch interim caretaker chair. He completed his term Thursday and did not seek an extension.
