Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo has refuted claims that he will support Governor Cornel Rasanga&#39;s re-election bid in August.Reacting to a story published in a local daily, Mr Midiwo maintained that he would never support Mr Rasanga. Midiwo said he had not reconciled with the governor regarding their political differences.&quot;Those peddling rumours that I have reconciled with Rasanga are daydreamers. I do not agree with the governor&#39;s style of leadership and I do not plan to back his gubernatorial bid,&quot; he said.Speaking in Gem sub-county, the MP said he had made a declaration to support either Rarieda MP Nicholas Gumbo or Rasanga&#39;s competitor in 2013, William Oduol, for the governor&#39;s seat.He however admitted having met with Rasanga at a family gathering held at the home of Siaya County Public Service Board chairman Joe Donde.
