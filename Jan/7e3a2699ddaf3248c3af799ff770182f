Onyango Oloo, who has been President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s point-man in Nyanza, joined ODM Wednesday with a promise to help party leader Raila Odinga win the coming elections.Mr Oloo, who was the secretary general of the defunct The National Alliance Party (TNA), which Uhuru used to get to power in 2013, said he would reveal Jubilee&#39;s secrets which he said will boost Raila&#39;s State House bid. He sensationally claimed President Kenyatta did not win the 2013 General Election but rigged his way to power even as Raila received him in Kisumu.&quot;It was very easy to steal votes in areas where ODM was not active,&quot; Oloo said as he joined the party he discredited for many years.Oloo said he felt betrayed by the Government he described as &#39;a den of thieves and ethnic chauvinists&#39;.

I know everything that went wrong for Raila in 2013, he would be president today,&quot; Oloo said.A section of ODM supporters, unhappy with Oloo&#39;s move to join the party, attempted to block him from accessing the podium at Jomo Kenyatta Sports ground where Raila was addressing a rally.Raila had to pause his speech and intervene for Oloo to be allowed on the dais.

The passion I used to send Raila to the Opposition in 2013 is the same passion I will use to send Uhuru to the same opposition,&quot; said Oloo.While receiving him to the party, Raila said: &quot;Oloo had gone to the side of our enemies but has seen the light. I urge others to follow suit as the door is still open.&quot;Before meeting Raila, Oloo met over 50 former TNA officials from Kisumu, Siaya, Migori, Homa Bay, Baringo and Kakamega counties where they all declared they will throw their weight behind Raila ahead of the August 8 elections.The former officials accused President Kenyatta&#39;s team of &#39;conmanship&#39; by pushing out TNA&#39;s founding and branch officials during the formation of Jubilee Party.Oloo singled out Deputy President William Ruto who he said was the reason former TNA officials from 28 other counties were on their way to ODM.He said he regretted approving the merger that saw TNA, Ruto&#39;s United Republican Party (URP) and a host of other smaller parties, a move he said had caused more harm than good for Uhuru in his re-election bid.Oloo said most of the ills in the Jubilee government, including massive corruption, originated from the DP&#39;s side.
