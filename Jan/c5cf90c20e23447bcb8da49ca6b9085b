National Assembly Majority Leader Aden Duale has said MPs might be recalled to vet the electoral agency nominees.Speaking to the Press in Garissa town, Mr Duale said once the Speaker receives names of nominees for the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairman and commissioners from the President, he will automatically send them to the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee. The committee will then commence the process of vetting and subsequently table its report on the nominees for approval or rejection.&quot;By tomorrow, we expect the Speaker to call a one-day special sitting so that the House can either adopt or reject the report on the IEBC nominees,&quot; he said.President Uhuru Kenyatta nominated Wafula Chebukati for the position of IEBC chairman and six commissioners; Consolata Nkatha Bucha, Boya Molu, Roselyn Akombe, Paul Kurgat, Margaret Wanjala Mwachanya and Abdi Guliye.

There is nowhere in the Constitution that says the IEBC chairman and CEO should not come from the same community,&quot; he added.
