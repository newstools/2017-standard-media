Gospel artiste Emmy Kosgei will hold peace campaigns in major counties across the country ahead of the August General Election.In the campaign themed &ldquo;Fostering Co-existence and Soberness among Kenyans for Sustainable Development&rdquo;, the celebrated artist is collaborating with the National Authority for Campaigns against Alcohol and Drug Abuse (Nacada). &ldquo;Peace is a long-term process and it needs a long-term approach. We started the Pamoja Peace Concert in 2009 with Daddy Owen, with the aim of preaching peace through our music,&rdquo; Ms Kosgei said yesterday.&ldquo;We are going to push for a sober nation in this year&rsquo;s campaign because during elections, many young people engage in substance abuse, which may result in rioting. If we have a sober nation, it is easier to reduce crime.&rdquo;The award-winning artist believes that music is a powerful tool for preaching peace and she is working with like-minded artists, Government institutions, community institutions and elders to achieve this goal.She is scheduled to roll out the campaign in Nairobi, Narok, Kericho, Nakuru, Baringo and Mombasa among other counties. Central region will also feature in the initiative.&ldquo;We are doing this with other like-minded artists in the country, leaders, police and other influential personalities with the same passion. Peace is a collective responsibility for each Kenyan and we call upon other institutions who are willing to work with us to join in this noble cause ahead of the elections,&rdquo; she added.She noted that she was a victim of the 2008 post-election violence.&ldquo;I suffered during that period and I know what it means to have peace. I was a victim because I was stuck in Dagoretti, where I was living. I had 15 people in my house and people were attacking others from different communities. The landlord hid us for a week before we were rescued by a good Samaritan.&rdquo;&nbsp;
