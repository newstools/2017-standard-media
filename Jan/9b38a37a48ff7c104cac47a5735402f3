Large numbers of residents in various parts of Meru County will not be able to register as voters in the on-going exercise, because of various reasons, including uncollected National Identity Cards.In the last few days of the Mass Voter Registration, it has emerged that many residents had been turned away at registration centres owing to the fact that they only have the old generation National Identity Cards.Kaindio Mauta, the IEBC Officer in charge of Igembe Central Sub County, also revealed that piles of uncollected IDs were lying at chiefs&#39; camps and registrar of persons offices, denying owners the opportunity to vote. &quot;There is also disinterest and lack of knowledge. But we have dispatched educators on a sensitization mission in the grassroots to get them to come and register, and ensure they participate in the August 8 election,&quot; Mauta said.President Uhuru Kenyatta is expected to tour Meru, on a mission to rally residents support the Jubilee Party and to register as voters.Those who did not change their old IDs for new ones are flocking registration centres in large numbers but to their disappointment the registration officers are turning them back.

The registrar of persons is telling us many IDs are in his office, and others are at chiefs&#39; offices for as many as five years. If their owners do not collect them it means they will not be able to vote,&quot; Mauta said.Mauta added: &quot;We are not happy with the low turnout so far. We would like to advise voters not to wait until the last-minute rush because our kits can serve an average of 100 persons per day,&quot; said Mr Mauta.
