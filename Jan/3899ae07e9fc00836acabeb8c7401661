Britain&#39;s Natural History Museum bids farewell to its most famous exhibit, Dippy the diplodocus, on Wednesday after almost four decades of greeting visitors before being dismantled ahead of a national tour.For 35 years, the huge skeleton cast, 4.25 metres (14 ft) high and 21 metres long, has been the first sight visitors see when they enter the London museum&#39;s main entrance. On Thursday, a team begins the three-week process of dismantling Dippy before conservators spend 12 months preparing the delicate plaster-of-Paris cast for the journey around Britain where it will go on show at eight locations from 2018 until 2020.From the end of 2020, a bronze cast of Dippy will then go on display outside the museum.Scottish-born American industrialist Andrew Carnegie originally presented the 292-bone cast to the museum in 1905, and it has held its prominent position in the main entrance hall since 1979.Dippy will be replaced by a 25.2 metre real skeleton of a blue whale as part of a major overhaul.Diplodocus was first described as a new type of dinosaur in 1878 by Professor Othniel C. Marsh at Yale University. The herbivore species lived sometime between 156 and 145 million years ago and belongs to a group called sauropods, meaning &#39;lizard feet&#39;.
