(Photo: Joseph Muchiri/Standard)Keen to reap big from an acrimonious fallout in the big parties, small political outfits are now selling membership and nomination certificates to aggrieved politicians.Short of financial largese to splash on grand launches, these political parties are deploying technology to reach aspirants and make materials like posters and T-shirts easily downloadable. Key in their strategy is digital access for membership and nomination certificates, keeping nomination fees rock bottom and online payment applications for candidates.Through technology, they have made it easy for an aspiring candidate to enlist as a party member, pay for nomination certificate, mount a campaign using readily available publicity materials and get elected without ever meeting party officials or travelling to Nairobi.&ldquo;It is working. The beauty of it is we do not prescribe what presidential candidate our members support. We leave it to them to choose. Technology allows the party to offer support services to the candidates online without requiring them to attend tedious meetings in Nairobi,&rdquo; said Mr Isaiah Ndirangu, chairman of Party Democratic Union (PDU).

Kenyans will be surprised when parties file returns with the registrar of political parties in April,&rdquo; he said.PDU charges Sh5,000 for a Member of County Assembly (MCA) certificate.Ndirangu says this has encouraged a lot of young people because it is affordable.In return, the party updates their candidates on legal and administrative requirements, helps process Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) and other statutory compliance requirements on behalf of the candidate online.Keen on curtailing competition and boosting their dominant political muscle, the big boys agreed with speed to a raft of stringent compliance conditions under the Political Parties Act in 2012. Among the conditions was one requiring parties to maintain not less than 24 county branches to function legally.Forced into a corner, small parties ganged up to register the Political Parties Forum Coalition (PPFC) in 2012, under which they have shared resources like offices and collectively lobbied against dictatorial tendencies by established outfits like Jubilee and CORD.

Many politicians have secured a plan B by taking out multiple certificates from small parties,&rdquo; said Mr David Wakahu, the Forum&rsquo;s board chair.Among those listed as PDU&rsquo;s aspirants are Walter Wakhungu (governor Lamu), Kamau Macharia (governor Nairobi) and Weldon Korir (Senator, Bomet)Democratic Party Chairman Esau Kioni said there were several surprise names on it&rsquo;s list.
