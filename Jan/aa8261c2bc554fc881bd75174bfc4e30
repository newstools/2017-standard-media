Rogue youths are taking advantage of voter registration campaigns to harass and extort locals, police have said.Nyanza Regional Police Co-ordinator Willy Lugusa said stern action would be taken against those found culpable, adding that five people had already been arrested in Kondele and Mamboleo.&quot;What these people are doing is very far from voter mobilisation. We have already instructed our officers to arrest anyone who is creating lawlessness in the name of voter mobilisation,&quot; he said. Kisumu Governor Jack Ranguma, who was headed to town from Nyalenda yesterday, came face to face with youths who had put up an illegal road block in Kachok, the entry point to the city from Nairobi Road.He commended the youths for a &quot;good job&quot;, saying, &quot;Even I have carried my voter&#39;s card. I support this initiative.&quot;Mr Ranguma said it was the same in other parts of the country and he was glad the youths were doing it in Kisumu.

This caused a huge traffic jam along Ring Road leading to Nyalenda estate.Some residents used boda bodas to access the central business district through back alleys. They said although the initiative was meant for a good cause, some youths were using it for extortion.&quot;One youth accosted me and forcefully took Sh200 from my purse as I tried to take out my voter&#39;s card for them to allow me through,&quot; said a woman who identified herself only as Rose.&quot;It is not practical to move around everywhere with the voter&#39;s card so this harassment is not necessary. The youths should move around with the biometric (voter registration) machines to check our registration status,&quot; said another traveller.

The ambush is unnecessary,&quot; she complained.Wycliffe Owuor said he had to part with Sh50 when he ran into the group of youths.&quot;They said it was a fine for not walking with my voter&#39;s card even though I have one that I left at home. And I was not alone - everyone who did not have their card was forced to part with the same amount or even more,&quot; he said.Boda boda operators barricaded the busy Rongo-Isebania road for the same purpose.Brigadier Agwenge, chairman of the Migori town boda boda operators, told The Standard they would continue ensuring that everyone in Migori County got an ID and voter&#39;s card.Migori ODM county chairman Philip Makabong&#39;o condemned the harassment even as he said the youths had a right to mobilise residents to register as voters.
