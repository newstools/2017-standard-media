&nbsp;President Uhuru Kenyatta delivers new year message in Mombasa.(Photo:Courtesy)The Government has maintained a hardline stance on demands by striking health workers. In his end of year speech, President Uhuru Kenyatta dashed any hopes of a peaceful resolution of the current standoff with the medics, indicating that the Government was not stable enough financially to meet their demands.The President insisted that since the strike commenced on December 5, 2016, the Government had been burning the midnight oil to find a solution.But he reiterated that the Government had to contend with the overall wage bill when making a decision on what to pay.
