A row has erupted between two government agencies over the ownership of a seven-acre prime property.Kenya Agricultural Research and Livestock Organisation (Kalro) is accusing the National Irrigation Board (NIB) of&nbsp;allocating the piece of land that houses its research centre to private individuals.&nbsp;According to the research centre&#39;s manager, John Kimani, the land in question houses an ongoing construction of a Sh100 million ultra-modern molecular research laboratory. Dr Kimani said the centre was a quarantine zone due to the nature of research activities it hosts, and that allowing intruders to occupy the land would pose serious risks to members of the public.&quot;Quarantined research areas are always unsafe to the general public world over and I wonder why the NIB found it fit to allocate this land to private individuals without consulting us,&quot; Kimani said.The development saw all the 15 advisory committee members of the NIB&#39;s Mwea office sent packing last Friday.
