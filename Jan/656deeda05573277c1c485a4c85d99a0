Busia Governor Sospeter Ojaamong has challenged leaders behind the National Super Alliance (NASA) to tell Kenyans what their core agenda is.The governor said there was need for the much-publicised coalition to make clear its goals rather than focus merely on changing the presidency. &quot;Other leaders are uniting Kenyans. We want all formations to have an agenda that serves Kenyans besides just replacing the presidency. Even NASA must give us the agenda rather than a formula for removing the President because that is what messes up the nation,&quot; he said.Addressing worshippers at Kolanya Salvation Army in Teso North constituency, Mr Ojaamong urged locals to stick to ODM party, cautioning them against falling into the Jubilee &quot;trap&quot;.However, Funyula MP Paul Otuoma and his Matayos counterpart Geoffrey Odanga affirmed that Western region was fully behind NASA.
