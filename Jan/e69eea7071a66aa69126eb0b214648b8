EMBU, KENYA: Kenya&#39;s aviation authorities have allowed Embu County Government to develop Embu airstrip for domestic flights.Kenya Civil Aviation Authority (KCAA) Director General Gilbert Kibe and Kenya Airports Authority (KAA) Managing Director Jonny Andersen said it was possible for the county government to use the airstrip even though it is under the Interior Ministry.Speaking when they paid Governor Martin Wambora a courtesy call, they said the facility can be transformed into an airport and be used for commercial purposes. Captain Kibe advised there was a need to clear some overgrown trees to the west of the airstrip and relocate the garbage to ensure there were no birds in way of the airplanes.He observed that using Isiolo international airport for nondomestic flights would be more viable instead of expanding the local airstrip.Wambora said he had received bids from international investors who wanted to use the airstrip for commercial purposes.

Moyale has military personnel but civilians use it,&quot; he said.The county chief said people living near the airstrip had already been compensated and would leave anytime the airstrip becomes operational.
