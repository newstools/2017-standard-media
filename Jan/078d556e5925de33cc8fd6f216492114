The Government is yet to disburse Sh15 billion from the Constituency Development Fund (CDF) to constituencies.This is six months to the next elections, even as MPs scramble to complete stalled projects ahead of the polls.A national CDF status report tabled in the National Assembly indicates out of the country&#39;s 290 constituencies, only Kamukunji in Nairobi has received its full allocation (Sh81 million), with the rest of the billions lying in the accounts of the CDF board. According to the document, only Sh9 billion of the total Sh25 billion CDF allocations have been given out.Kamukunji, represented by Yusuf Hassan, is followed by Kilgoris under Gideon Konchellah, which has received 90 per cent of the funds (Sh81.5 million).The report was tabled in compliance with Section 51 (1) of the Act which requires the CDF board to submit a quarterly report detailing a summary of the project proposals received from the constituencies, and a summary of the status of disbursements to the constituencies, among others.
