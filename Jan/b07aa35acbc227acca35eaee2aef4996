TURKANA, KENYA: Deputy President William Ruto has cautioned leaders from Turkana County against politicising the Petroleum Exploration and Development and Production Bill. Ruto assured residents that the Government would ensure that there is sufficient consultations on the Memorandum by President Uhuru Kenyatta explaining his refusal to assent to the Bill which is before the Senate. His remarks comes in the wake of opposition by some local leaders over Government plans to amend the Bill to deny local communities 10 percent oil share benefit as earlier proposed and reduce it to five per cent. Speaking in Turkana over the weekend the Deputy Presidents said the Jubilee Government was ready to ensure that Turkana County develops like other parts of Kenya and leaders should not use the Bill to play politics. &quot;All quarters will receive their share of the revenue. There should be a balance. The National, County and the people of Kenya should receive a section of the revenues. That is why we have the Bill being discussed at the Senate level. We do not want politics in that sector,&quot; said Ruto. &nbsp;
