Jubilee Party will swap party officials presiding over nominations in the counties to ensure fair and transparent nominations.President Uhuru Kenyatta yesterday said this would ensure that no aspirant was disadvantaged during the party primaries.&ldquo;When we say we are standing for free and fair nominations, we mean it. Party officials at county level will be swapped during nominations so that the officials of one county are deployed to oversee the nominations in another county,&rdquo; the President told a leaders&rsquo; meeting in Maralal, Samburu County. &ldquo;County officials will be swapped during nominations to avoid bias. The officials in Samburu County could be sent to another county and the officials from Kwale can come and oversee the nominations here.&rdquo;Uhuru said his party would also request the support of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) in conducting credible nominations.TONE DOWN ALSO READ: Jubilee Party facing a political storm in KisiiWhile asking Jubilee Party rivals to tone down their differences, Uhuru reiterated that neither he nor his deputy William Ruto had preferred candidates and that aspirants should stop aligning themselves hoping to get favours.&ldquo;There is democracy in Jubilee Party and all aspirants contesting for various seats should know that we have no preferred candidates.
