Why reported intelligence about an impeding attack was not acted upon is among the burning questions a year since the attack on a Kenya military camp in Somalia.Yesterday marked one year since gallant soldiers from the Kenya Defence Forces (KDF) paid with their life to defend the country at El Adde. The January 15 attack saw at least 210 men killed, badly wounded or go missing.As the country marks one year since the KDF soldiers paid the ultimate sacrifice, there are some lessons that must have been learnt.The need for accurate and actionable intelligence reports remains one of the biggest assets the country must perfect to protect its men from Al Shabaab. It is still unclear what exactly Major Geoffrey Obwoge, the commanding office at El Adde knew or and didn&#39;t about the impeding attack that cost him and his men their lives.

Why he decided to keep so calm. Was he protecting us or was he not aware of the intelligence?&quot; a survivor said.There are also multiple lessons on how troops rehearse coordination points, defensive positions, and procedures to adopt in case of attack.This was after it emerged there might have been a major breakdown in defensive procedures that reportedly saw as many as 20 KDF troops escape the base in two trucks early on in the battle.Securing communication networks is also an important lesson.The African Union Mission in Somalia (Amisom) may not have put in place solid back-up to deal with the communication challenge after Al Shabaab attacked and destroyed the local Hormuud telecommunications tower. This cut communication, weakening their defence position.
