A major achievement of the of the Matiang&rsquo;i era that hardly features in accolades&nbsp; for the charismatic Cabinet Secretary and his team &nbsp;is his roll out of the aptly named Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) model schools&nbsp; the moment he stepped into his predecessor Prof Jacob Kaimenyi&rsquo;s shoes a year ago. The Director of the Centre for Mathematics, Science and Technology&nbsp; Education in Africa (CEMASTEA) that supports the initiative Mr Stephen Njoroge says Kenyans have been carried away Dr Matiangi&rsquo;s &nbsp;relentless efforts to inject sanity into a discredited examination sector that&nbsp; a gallant achievement&nbsp; poised to take the country into the industrial age goes unnoticed.Mr Njoroge laments the low enrolment in STEM related subjects driven by the urge to score higher grades in easier humanity options.Initially 47 in number, one in each of the 47 Counties, STEM schools&nbsp; will in July this this year double to 94 and&nbsp; continue increasing by the same number &nbsp;annually with the potential of taking technology to a higher level and thus&nbsp; open the vista for competition with Asian Tigers that have industrialized fast in 50 years of independence.

Impunity has become the norm in our schools to the detriment of healthy learning&rdquo;, noted Mr Farrah.
