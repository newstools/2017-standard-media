Washington: President-elect Donald Trump began a long holiday weekend that honors slain black civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. by blasting another African-American activist and politician who said he doesn&#39;t see Trump as a &quot;legitimate president&quot;.Democratic Representative John Lewis, of Georgia, had said on a segment of &quot;Meet the Press&quot; released by NBC on Friday he thought hacking by Russians had helped Trump, a Republican, get elected in November. Lewis said he does not plan to attend Trump&#39;s Jan. 20 inauguration, the first time he&#39;d missed such an event since being elected to the House in 1986.On Saturday Trump tweeted that Lewis was falsely complaining about election results and instead &quot;should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested).&quot;&quot;All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!&quot; Trump tweeted.Lewis, who has been a civil rights leader for more than half a century, was beaten by police during a march he helped lead in 1965 in Selma, Alabama, drawing attention to hurdles for blacks to vote. He protested alongside King that day and on other occasions.
