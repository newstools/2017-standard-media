Jubilee leaders have dismissed the push by the Opposition leaders to form a broad-based alliance.The leaders said the Opposition cannot mount any serious threat to President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s re-election bid. The Government-allied leaders said despite the hype around the Opposition leaders meeting at Bomas of Kenya yesterday, the rally ended with nothing new coming from the principals.They termed it as a gathering of 2013 losers whose consolidated votes could still not match the votes garnered by President Uhuru and his deputy, William Ruto.Deputy President William Ruto said the Opposition disclosed nothing new to win the heart of Kenyans.

They are just interested in creating positions for themselves to achieve their selfish ends,&quot; said Ruto.And Majority Leader Aden Duale said: &quot;At Bomas, there was nothing more than the usual political rhetoric that we are used to from them during burials and rallies. It was just like a rally moved to Bomas. No new faces, no new ideas that can shift the political ground.&quot;Mr Duale said Jubilee will not be cowed by the coming together of the Opposition, adding that the scenario would not be any different from that of 2013.&quot;All those who were at Bomas were in the ballot in the last elections and we beat them. They can choose now to compete with us as a group or as individuals but we will still trounce them,&quot; said the Garissa Township MP.His sentiments were echoed by his Senate counterpart Kithure Kindiki, who said the only addition to the &quot;tradition&quot; Opposition was ANC leader Mr Mudavadi &quot;but whose votes in the last elections cannot still tilt the poll against Jubilee&quot;.&quot;I listened to the leaders and the only new thing I heard was them saying they would not resort to street demos,&quot; Prof Kindiki said.
