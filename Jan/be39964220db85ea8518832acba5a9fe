Lands Cabinet Secretary Jacob Kaimenyi has issued titled deeds to 20,000 residents of Nyatike, Migori County.The residents who have been living as squatters since independence heaved a sigh of relief after receiving the vital documents.Kaimenyi expressed concern that the national government had processed more than 41,180 tittle deeds since Jubilee came to power, but only 38 per cent had been collected over the years. He urged all Kenyans to collect their title deeds. &quot;In Western and Nyanza, when we visited the ground, we found out that parents fear taking title deeds for fear of being killed by their children,&quot; he said.He gave shocking statistics that more than 83 per cent of public schools land in Kenya had been grabbed.The CS added that the Government had waived title deeds processing and survey fees, making it easier for individuals to acquire titles.
