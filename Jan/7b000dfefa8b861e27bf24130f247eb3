Tea prices at the Mombasa auction started 2017 on a slow note to register a sharp drop compared to prices at the last auction of 2016.According to data released by the African Tea Brokers (ATB), the highest price of the best Kenyan tea, also known as Best Broken Pekoe Ones (BP1s), this week ranged between $3.38 (Sh344.76) and $4.20 (Sh427.52) per kilo.This is compared to $3.50 (Sh356.27) and $4.26 (Sh433.63) per kilo at the last auction of 2016. Kenya is the world&rsquo;s top exporter of black tea, which is one of the country&rsquo;s main foreign exchange earners.The sharp drop in tea prices comes despite the strengthening of the US dollar against the shilling, a trend industry insiders had hoped would have lifted farmers&rsquo; earnings.A strong dollar means good returns for Kenyan tea farmers and traders since tea is auctioned at the Mombasa tea auction in dollars.

In all the 52 weeks of a year, the last week of the year is when the auction does not take place. So this could simply be traders trying to get a bearing as the year starts,&rdquo; explained Mr Mudibo.He said he was pleased with the strengthening of the dollar, since tea farmers are now going to earn more per kilo.&ldquo;Small-scale tea farmers have everything to be happy about with the strengthening of the dollar. The only people who will suffer in this industry are the few large-scale farmers who have bought heavy machinery through loans taken in dollars since they have to repay them in the same currency,&rdquo; said Mr Mudibo.
