Ministry of Interior&nbsp;Principal Secretary Karanja Kibicho risks being in contempt of court for failing to pay Sh1.3 million to an elderly man who sued the State.Mr Kibicho failed to honour a High Court ruling of October 4, 2016, compelling him to pay Dominic Munguti Kitika within 21 days. The order was the second one after the PS failed to comply with an earlier order of May 27, 2016. In December 2016, Mr Kitika asked the court to summon the PS to explain why he had not complied.
