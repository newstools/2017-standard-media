Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu is expected to meet representatives of the striking doctors this morning in the hope that the stalemate will finally be resolved.&nbsp;Dr Mailu yesterday confirmed the meeting, which comes just a day to the deadline the court gave Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) officials to sort the matter out or face jail.The meeting also comes just four days after another one, after which Mailu said he was going to brief President Uhuru Kenyatta about discussions. The talks were set to resume last Thursday to discuss in detail the contentious collective bargaining agreement KMPDU said it signed with the Government.But KMPDU officials claimed the Government had not reached out to them since then for feedback or invitation to another meeting.SPONSORED HASHTAGS ALSO READ: Doctors' union officials face jail for contempt&quot;Doctors have been on strike for 50 days to ask for better terms and better healthcare but the Government heartlessly responds by sponsored hashtags on social media,&quot; said KMPDU Secretary General Ouma Oluga.But Mailu rekindled hopes yesterday evening that the strike could end to alleviate the suffering of Kenyans when he announced today&#39;s meeting.Mailu was optimistic a solution would be found within the window that leaves union officials with tomorrow alone.&quot;I have an early morning meeting with the union leadership. I remain optimistic that if used well, the window left could lead to hope for the doctors and the country,&quot; Mailu said.If an agreement is not reached, the union officials will be jailed as per the January 12 contempt of court ruling by Industrial Court judge Hellen Wasilwa.The doctors yesterday refuted claims that they were planning to resist arrest on Thursday.&quot;Why resist when there is already a court order? In fact, we will present ourselves in court at 8:30am on Thursday.
