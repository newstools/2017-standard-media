A military commander with West Africa&rsquo;s regional bloc on Wednesday said its forces will &ldquo;take action&rdquo; at midnight unless a solution is found to Gambia&rsquo;s political crisis before then.Speaking on Senegalese radio station RFM, Seydou Maiga Mboro declared &ldquo;all the troops are already in place&rdquo; awaiting the deadline for President Yahya Jammeh to step down. Witnesses in Senegal have reported seeing troops making their way toward Gambia&rsquo;s borders.Jammeh has refused to cede power after 22 years at the helm despite losing the December 1 election to Adama Barrow.The president-elect has vowed to go ahead with his inauguration anyway today, and Ecowas, the regional bloc, has vowed to use military force if necessary to remove him.

Jammeh seized power in a coup in 1994 and his government has gained a reputation among ordinary Gambians and human rights activists for torturing and killing opponents.Few people expected him to lose the election and the result was greeted with joy by many in the country and by democracy advocates across the continent, particularly when Jammeh initially said he would accept the result and step down.Jammeh&rsquo;s decision to reverse that position has created political turmoil. At least five ministers have resigned from his government, hundreds of people have fled to neighbouring Senegal and others in the country say they fear violence.&ldquo;People are afraid, we don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s going to happen,&rdquo; said a restaurant worker who gave only his first name, Musa, at an eatery in the capital Banjul normally buzzing but now empty of tourists.
