A section of leaders from Baringo have criticised Deputy President William Ruto for meddling in their county politics.Led by Erick Bett, a Kanu MCA aspirant, they took issue with the recent Sugoi declaration where the DP endorsed Betting and Licensing Control Board member Simon Chelugui for the Baringo senator&#39;s position. &quot;We condemn anyone who think they can give us a line up of people to be elected. People of Baringo know who to elect and who to neglect,&quot; said Bett during a press conference in Kabarnet. He said they were surprised at his Chelugui&#39;s about turn because he had early expressed interest in the gubernatorial seat but later changed his mind for what they termed selfish interests. &quot;Chelugui has been interested in the area gubernatorial seat, news that he is vying for senator&#39;s seat shocked us and confirms the belief that he was a political broker using the goodwill of the people for his selfish interest,&quot; said Bett.He took issue with the fact that Ruto was setting up Chelugui against Baringo Senator Gideon Moi for selfish interests. Amos Olempaka an ODM parliamentary aspirant said the political wave experienced in Baringo is suspect. &quot;Ruto has been visiting Baringo and Bomet Counties, unfortunately it has clearly been revealed that he is doing it for his own personal interests and not for the interest of the people,&quot; said Olempaka. They called on the DP to respect the democratic rights of people of Baringo as they know the leaders they want. ALSO READ: Anger as DP Ruto handpicks candidate to challenge Gideon
