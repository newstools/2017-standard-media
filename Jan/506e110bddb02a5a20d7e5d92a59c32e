A ward representative in Bungoma County has asked Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula to shelve his presidential ambitions and go for the Bungoma governor&#39;s seat instead.Kabuchai/Chwele Ward Rep Barasa Mukhongo said the Ford Kenya party leader should battle it out with the sitting governor, Kenneth Lusaka, of Jubilee Party. Mr Mukhongo claimed it would be easier for Wetang&#39;ula to win the governor&#39;s seat than the competitive presidential position. Speaking in the neighbouring Luhya/Bwake Ward in Kabuchai constituency yesterday, Mukhongo said Wetang&#39;ula would be the ideal candidate for the governor&#39;s race. &quot;It is easier for him to win the governor&#39;s race than the presidential race, which is very crowded,&quot; he said.
