Today marks the start of the month-long voter registration across the country. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC), targets to register at least six million voters from the estimated nine million who have acquired national identification cards in the period after the 2013 General Election to date.It is the duty and right of every eligible voter to register and exercise their constitutional right to elect their representatives to the presidency, the Senate, National Assembly, the county assemblies and governorship. As often said, bad leaders are chosen by good people who refrain from voting, thus allowing unpopular leaders to sneak through and subject them to five years of mis-governance. It is not enough that Kenyans should complain of bad leadership when the fault lies with them. The destiny of this country is in your hands. What enables you to shape that destiny is your vote, so go for it. It is particularly important for political parties and individual aspirants to make this exercise a success.In the past, as evidenced in the last registration exercise, voter apathy was a major concern. This apathy is caused by disillusionment and the little faith people have in our governance systems. ALSO READ: Uhuru, Raila to inspect voter registration exercise in strongholds
