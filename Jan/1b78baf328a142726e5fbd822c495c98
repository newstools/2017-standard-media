CORD has summoned all its elected leaders to a meeting to deliberate on the Senate&rsquo;s decision to pass the controversial amendments to the electoral laws and later announce their next step.Yesterday, CORD co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka said the outcome is a clear testament that the Jubilee government is planning to rig the elections. &ldquo;We are calling upon our affiliate members, both sitting and aspiring, to convene at the Bomas on January 11 to deliberate the outcome of the Senate. We will explore all possible options before we announce our decision to the country,&rdquo; said Kalonzo.The meeting at Bomas of Kenya in Nairobi on Wednesday will also be attended by aspirants of all elective positions in parties affiliated to the coalition.On Thursday, Jubilee used its numerical strength in the Senate to reject any changes to the Elections Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2015 that was passed by the National Assembly.

ALSO READ: What the Opposition wants with election law&ldquo;We will respond to the betrayal comprehensively, decisively and firmly,&rdquo; he said.Yesterday, CORD&rsquo;s other co-principals Kalonzo and Moses Wetang&rsquo;ula claimed that the vote of 24 to 19 in favour of Jubilee was rigged and pointed fingers at Senate Speaker Ekwe Ethuro.&ldquo;The speaker acted as a Jubilee Senator and allowed cheating. He let Senators not authorised to vote to cast their ballot,&rdquo; said Wetang&rsquo;ula.They said Ethuro allowed nominated Senators Naisula Lesuda and Hosea Ochwang&rsquo;i to cast their votes without subjecting the decision to the house. Senator Ochwang&rsquo;i came armed with a letter authorising him to vote on behalf of Kisii&rsquo;s Chris Obure. However, the letter did not quash an earlier one written by the senator that gave his voting rights to Janet Ong&rsquo;era.Had Ethuro not allowed the two to vote, CORD presumes that the count in the second reading would have been 22 to 19, which is below the threshold of 24 that allows a Bill to move to the next reading.&ldquo;The speaker rigged the election in conjunction with his conspirators. We are seeking to have the matter addressed. This is outright stealing,&rdquo; Wetang&rsquo;ula said.The coalition had postponed their planned peaceful demos that were to start last Tuesday to await the outcome of the Senate proceedings on the Bill.

We wonder if they will be willing to hand over power if they are ousted,&rdquo; said Jirongo.&ldquo;Our position has been and always will be that if you want to give back up to technology, then back it up with technology,&rdquo; said Wetang&rsquo;ula.
