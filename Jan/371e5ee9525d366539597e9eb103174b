The Kikuyu Council of Elders has called on politicians to go slow on agitation for implementation of the controversial Truth, Justice and Reconciliation (TJRC) report.In a statement, the elders also questioned CORD leader Raila Odinga&#39;s timing in calling for implementation of the report, warning that it could reignite animosity among communities ahead of the August General Election. A resolution passed during the council&#39;s annual prayers meeting in Kirinyaga County, said Raila&#39;s constant use of the TJRC report in his campaigns was a recipe for sparking hatred.The elders said repeated calls for implementation of the TJRC report to mitigate against historical land injustices against the Maasai community, was a ploy to gain electoral mileage.&quot;The Kikuyu community resolves that we will not tolerate any acts or utterances that could lead to bloodshed and destruction of life and property. We urge all Kenyans to reject incitement to violence and disorder for political reasons,&quot; the council organising secretary James Nene said. Mr Nene is also the Council&#39;s chair for Nakuru branch.
