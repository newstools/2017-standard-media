Trouble started when the DP invited Baringo North MP William Cheptumo and County Woman Representative Grace Kiptui to address the gathering.Ruto, who was accompanied by Rift Valley politicians, Cabinet Secretaries and government officials, watched as the leaders struggled to control the rowdy masses.Convincing win ALSO READ: Stop it!
