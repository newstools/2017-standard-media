Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) now wants government to stop harassing opposition leaders, particularly Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho.The party condemns the manner in which the State is manhandling, harassing and causing undue embarrassment to Deputy Party Leader Hassan Joho. Joho has been subject to intimidation and humiliation by the Jubilee administration who are uncomfortable with his stand on many ills and vices committed by them.&ldquo;It is an open secret that Governor Joho&rsquo;s woes began the day he rejected overtures by the government and their agencies to lead a mass defection from the opposition to Jubilee. He has since stood firm in the defence of the people of the Coast mostly who live as squatters on their own land. The fact that Hon. Joho commands massive support among the people of the Coast for his bravery to stand against Jubilee lies and propaganda has made him an enemy of the State hence the harassment,&rdquo; said ODM acting secretary general Senator Agnes Zani in a press statement. &nbsp;&ldquo;ODM would like to remind Jubilee that their failure to deliver on their election promises to the public, the massive public looting right from top to bottom and their increasing unpopularity should not be vented on innocent and hardworking opposition leaders.&rdquo; ALSO READ: 'The sea will speak soon' Kaya elders warn Jubilee&ldquo;We read mischief in the earlier statements by Government Spokesman Mr. Eric Kiraithe and the Coast Regional Co-ordinator Mr. Nelson Marwa and yesterday&rsquo;s subsequent arrest of Governor Joho and two Members of Parliament Hon. Abdulswamad Nassir and Hon. Rashid Bedzimba in Mombasa&rdquo;.ODM maintains that Jubilee government must serve her people equally and should embrace the basic democratic tenets of fair competition at all times.
