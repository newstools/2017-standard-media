Baringo North MP William Cheptumo, Woman Representative Grace Kiptui and Baringo Central MP Sammy Mwaita were booed by angry residents in front of the DP during a tour of the county.The legislators, who have been Ruto&#39;s key allies in the region, were forced to cut short their speeches as residents openly expressed their displeasure in Kabartonjo and Kabarnet.Yesterday, a group of residents joined the public protests at Kabel trading centre in Baringo South, accusing the Jubilee government of failing to develop the region despite receiving massive support in the 2013 elections.

On several occasions, the DP has been pleading with locals to vote for Jubilee Party aspirants.&quot;The Deputy President should stop forcing us to vote for individuals of his choice. We understand our challenges and we should be allowed to vote for the people we want,&quot; he said.
