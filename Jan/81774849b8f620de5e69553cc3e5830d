Some 2,000 sacked workers of Karuturi Flower Farm, now under receivership, have asked the Senate to intervene so the company can pay their dues, which run into millions.David Kilo, the workers&#39; spokesman, said receiver managers of the Naivasha-based company had also threatened to kick them out of company houses for unpaid rent.Mr Kilo said a school owned by the company also faced closure after parents were told to start paying fees, which they cannot afford. Electricity and water supply to the workers&#39; houses was also reportedly disconnected for unpaid bills. The workers said they feared contracting waterborne diseases as they were now forced to drink untreated water from Lake Naivasha.&quot;The company wants to kick us out of the houses yet we have nowhere else to go. We are also struggling to feed our children because the company has refused to pay us,&quot; Kilo said.He called on the company to also introduce a school feeding programme to retain pupils, claiming several children had died of hunger.
