Bingwa Sacco which operates an Agency office in the United Kingdom is set to open four new regional offices within the next three years.Chief Executive Officer Ms Jane Mugo said the new branches will be established in Mombasa, Machakos, Nakuru counties and Kitengela town in Kajiado County. The Sacco has two branches in Nairobi located at Githurai and Accra road within the Central business district. She said the Sacco&#39;s main mission is to cover the entire country and give it a competing edge with other financial institutions to enable members&#39; access cheap and accessible loans.&quot;Between last December and this month alone, we have given out loans to members to the tune of Sh2.3 billion since this is the period most parents require financial assistance for their children joining form one and universities,&quot; she said. At the same time, Mugo has assured members that the Sacco&#39;s Investment Wing will be operational by this April. She said members are being encouraged to invest in shares whose proceeds will be used to operationalise the Wing from where they will be reaping benefits. &nbsp;
