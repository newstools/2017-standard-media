Kipsigis elders have said political animosity involving local leaders is fuelling clashes between their community and the Maasai in Narok County.During a meeting of Ololmasani Council of Elders at a shrine in Abosi, the elders expressed concern that clashes between the two communities were disrupting development in the region and called for a lasting solution. &quot;If there is politics... we want the MP (Johanna Ng&#39;eno, Emurua Dikirr) and Narok Governor Samuel Tunai to sit down and tell us what needs to be done...&quot;Also, we want Isaac Ruto (Bomet governor) to leave us alone to sort out our own issues. He should stick to his county,&quot; said council chairman John arap Tonui.In the recent past, more than a dozen people have been killed in clashes between the Maasai and the Kipsigis in Kimintet ward, Trans Mara West.
