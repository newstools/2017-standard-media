Employees from more than a dozen U.S. government agencies have established a network of unofficial &quot;rogue&quot; Twitter feeds in defiance of what they see as attempts by President Donald Trump to muzzle federal climate change research and other science.Seizing on Trump&#39;s favorite mode of discourse, scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and other bureaus have privately launched Twitter accounts - borrowing names and logos of their agencies - to protest restrictions they view as censorship and provide unfettered platforms for information the new administration has curtailed.&quot;Can&#39;t wait for President Trump to call us FAKE NEWS,&quot; one anonymous National Park Service employee posted on the newly opened Twitter account @AltNatParkService. &quot;You can take our official twitter, but you&#39;ll never take our free time!&quot; The @RogueNASA account displayed an introductory disclaimer describing it as &quot;The unofficial &#39;Resistance&#39; team of NASA. Not an official NASA account.&quot; It beckoned readers to follow its feed &quot;for science and climate news and facts. REAL NEWS, REAL FACTS.&quot;The swift proliferation of such tweets by government rank-and-file followed internal directives several agencies involved in environmental issues have received since Trump&#39;s inauguration requiring them to curb their dissemination of information to the public.Last week, Interior Department staff were told to stop posting on Twitter after an employee re-tweeted posts about relatively low attendance at Trump&#39;s swearing-in, and about how material on climate change and civil rights had disappeared from the official White House website.

Many of their messages carried Twitter hashtags #resist or #resistance.
