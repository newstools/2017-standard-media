Deputy President William Ruto has accused the Opposition of playing divisive politics.Ruto said the Opposition&#39;s campaign strategy was to divide the country along ethnic lines.He further accused Opposition chief Raila Odinga of fanning what he termed as falsehoods on alleged malpractices on the ongoing voter registration. &quot;Why should he (Raila) have problems with everybody. The IEBC is just a referee but he is against it. That is why we changed the officials. But now they have turned against it again demanding a clean voter register, which again they have gone to court to oppose. Are these people (the Opposition) genuine?&quot; said Ruto.He denied claims that IEBC was registering foreigners as voters, saying the allegations were a sign of defeat within the Opposition camp ahead of the oncoming elections.Ruto said Kenyans were ready for free, fair and peaceful elections and that attempts by the Opposition to disrupt peace after sensing defeat will not succeed.

If there will be some consequences, then it will be in the ballot,&quot; said Ruto.He added: &quot;We do not want anymore incitement of violence or chaos. We want a peaceful election because it is the right of all Kenyans to vote the way they want. We should accept the way Kenyans will vote because it is their democratic right.&quot;Ruto defended the Jubilee administration against accusations of corruption and under-development.
