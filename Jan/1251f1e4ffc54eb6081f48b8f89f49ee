We are well ahead of the plans to deliver SGR project to Kenyans,&rdquo; Maina said.The MD added that in line with railway safety regulations, all the new set of trains will be tested to ensure safety compliance.Maina noted that testing of the SGR locomotives would commence in the next few days, with tests on the line commencing in March.&ldquo;Plans for quality assurance acceptance tests are under way,&rdquo; the MD said.He said that once the tests are complete, commercial services will begin with passengers boarding the trains to get first travel experience.&ldquo;Together with the project supervisor, TSDI-APEC &ndash;EDON Consortium ( TAEC), we want to ensure that everything is well in place at the commencement of operations,&rdquo; said the MD.

Average speed for these is 85 kph with transit times at 5 hours and 25 minutes for the 472 kilometre stretch.Maina said that the county passenger train has a lower average speed due to the more frequent stops at designated passenger stations.
