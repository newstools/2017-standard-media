Obwocha is said to have been named by some of the suspects who had been questioned early on and turned to blame game.&nbsp;Kemboi said five suspects will eventually be arraigned in court.EACC detectives later headed to Obwocha&#39;s house where three officers searched for further evidence linking him to the loss of the public money.
