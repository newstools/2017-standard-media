Leaders of an ad hoc group of protesters enraged by Republican Donald Trump&#39;s election as president of the United States vowed on Wednesday to disrupt his inauguration this week by blocking public access to the event.The DisruptJ20 protest group said it will send groups of demonstrators to the dozen entrances to the grassy National Mall where hundreds of thousands of people are expected to gather to watch Trump, who has never before held public office, be sworn in as president on the steps of the U.S. Capitol on Friday. &quot;We believe that it&#39;s our role and the role of any people with conscience to try to disrupt this inauguration and have a massive showing of resistance on that day,&quot; Samantha Miller, a DisruptJ20 organizer, said at a news conference.The U.S. Secret Service and Washington police are expecting some 900,000 people to pack into the area between the Capitol and White House on Friday to view the swearing-in and will have thousands of uniformed officers on site.Trump has angered many on the left with demeaning comments about women, immigrants and Muslims, a vow to repeal the sweeping healthcare reform law known as &quot;Obamacare&quot; and plans to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.
