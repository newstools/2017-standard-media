Amani National Congress (ANC) party leader Musalia Mudavadi says voting the Jubilee government out is his new year resolution.Musalia said Kenyans grappled with the hardest of times in 2016, citing high costs of living and corruption scandals. He claimed the high level of corruption in Jubilee&#39;s multi-billion projects had driven the country into debt to the tune of Sh3.6 trillion, arguing that some of the projects had little or no immediate economic value to the common Kenyan.&quot;I do hope Kenyans have had enough of Jubilee and will take a stand against corruption in August 2017,&quot; said Musalia.He appealed to Kenyans to join the National Super Alliance (Nasa) and register as voters in large numbers in readiness for the elections.

Kenya must return to the path of accountability, truth and justice. Nasa is not an end in itself but seeks to harness Kenyans to reclaim an honest government,&quot; said Musalia.He accused Jubilee of unfulfilled promises including employment for the youth and free secondary school education.&quot;Parents will be stuck with children in January 2017 with unaffordable demands on their meagre incomes; they must still look for school fees even when the Jubilee promised to remove or reduce such levies. Others will not know what to do with children who cannot join secondary school or go to university.&quot;Musalia further criticised the new amendments to the election laws proposed by the Jubilee government, insisting on free and fair electionsAnother presidential hopeful, Philip Murgor also criticised Jubilee for pushing for amendments to the electoral laws.&quot;The attempt by the Jubilee Government to unilaterally enact amendments that compromise the integrity of electoral laws was both ill-considered and reckless,&quot; said the city lawyer.CREDIBLE EXPLANATION ALSO READ: Uhuru will be Ruto's chief campaigner in 2022, says ShebeshHe argued that since the 2013 polls, a credible explanation had never been offered by the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission on why two million Kenyans voted only in the presidential election and for no other elective positions.With corruption out of control, and negative ethnicity at an all-time high, Mr Murgor said the coming elections would be a particularly defining moment for the country.Murgor asked the President to prioritise national interests and refuse to rubber-stamp the controversial and divisive amendments into law.&quot;I humbly request all Kenyans to reflect on the significance of the coming election as an opportunity for peaceful change. Bullets and teargas cannot be the basis of sustainable peace and security. Only a credible win will provide legitimacy to a president,&quot; said Murgor.
