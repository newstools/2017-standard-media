The electoral agency has registered only 78,024 new voters in Coast&#39;s six counties in the first week of the mass voter registration.This low listing has caused anxiety within political circles in Coast, especially within CORD, whose co-principal Raila Odinga begins a tour of Kilifi this morning to rally support for the exercise.In the last elections, Coast registered 1.9 million voters out of a projected 2.9 million and only 57 per cent voted on March 4, 2013. The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) aims to register a million new voters, including 343,544 in Mombasa and 300,000 in Kilifi counties.The exercise entered its second week Monday as the IEBC officials raised a red flag especially in areas like Lamu and Tana River, which have listed the lowest number of voters, warning that it may not meet its target of a million new voters for the region.Statistics given by the IEBC Monday reveal that in the South Coast region, Mombasa, Kwale and Taita Taveta counties had jointly listed only about 50,000 new voters. The least figures were recorded in Taita Taveta County while Kwale had the best returns.

We were expecting to register at least 50,000 voters in every week but by now we have registered 28,000 voters,&quot; said Amina.She said Kilifi County, which is the largest county of the three in the region, recorded a higher number of votes at 21,586.

If you have lost it, be assured that you will participate in the voting exercise. One important thing for the election day is your identification card,&quot; she said.
