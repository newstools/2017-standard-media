Indiscipline is the leading cause of poor academic performance in Kenyan primary schools according to a new report by the Kenya National Examinations Council (Knec).The survey says at least 98 per cent of head teachers interviewed said their schools experienced indiscipline. The report titled National Assessment System for Monitoring Learner Achievement (NASMLA) says nine out of 10 teachers reported cases of indiscipline in their schools.Some of the common forms of indiscipline cited by the report include absenteeism, noise making and truancy.Half of the indiscipline cases involved lateness according to the research conducted late last year.
