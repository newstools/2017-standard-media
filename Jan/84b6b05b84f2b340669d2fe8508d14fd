Kanu has distanced itself from remarks by its Secretary General Nick Salat&nbsp;that it is a member of the Opposition&rsquo;s National Super Alliance (Nasa).The party&rsquo;s National Executive Committee member Zipporah Kittony said a decision to join a coalition ahead of the August General Election can only be made by its National Delegates Conference (NDC) upon resolution. &ldquo;Kenya African National Union (Kanu) supports the idea in its formative stage of Opposition unity in that this and the resolve by Opposition leaders to field one presidential candidate is a milestone for Kenya&rsquo;s growing democracy,&rdquo; the nominated senator said in a statement.&ldquo;However, the remarks made by Nick Salat, the Secretary General of Kanu today (yesterday) at the Bomas of Kenya are his personal sentiments and do not reflect in any way the position of the party on the matter of an election coalition at this juncture.&rdquo;The party said it has not convened its top organ over the direction the party will take in the forthcoming polls.
