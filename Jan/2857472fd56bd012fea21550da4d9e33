Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery and his predecessor, Joseph Ole Lenku, buried the hatchet in a traditional ceremony held over the weekend.In a move likely to change the politics of Kajiado County, the two leaders, who have not been seeing eye to eye, vowed to work together to popularise the Government&#39;s agenda within Maasailand and the country at large. In a ceremony conducted by 100 Maasai elders, both leaders ended the rivalry that has been simmering since Nkaissery replaced Ole Lenku at the Interior ministry three years ago.Nkaissery relinquished his political seat as the Kajiado Central Member of Parliament to replace Lenku at the Interior ministry.It took the intervention of the Nkaissery&#39;s age set, Oseuri, who are the senior-most elders to bring the two leaders together after years.

I want to be governor to unite these communities and to ensure they are treated fairly,&quot; he said.Lenku used the occasion to outline his political agenda.&quot;My prime focus is to bolster education. Other priority areas include boosting water supply, empowerment of women and youth through programmes aimed at uplifting their lives. I am fully aware of the need for gender equality which is the cornerstone of development. When women and men are equal in a society, economies flourish,&quot; he said.&quot;Improving sanitation is also top on my agenda and I hope to achieve this by partnering with the national government. Many areas in Kajiado are inaccessible because of poor roads, I want to remedy this,&quot; he said.
