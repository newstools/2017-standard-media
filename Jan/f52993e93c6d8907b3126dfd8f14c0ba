The Opposition has threatened to move to court to challenge President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s suitability to defend his seat, escalating a row over how Jubilee won the 2013 presidential election.Siaya Senator James Orengo on Sunday said the Opposition was reviewing fresh claims by a former Jubilee insider Onyango Oloo, against the evidence rejected by the Supreme Court during the unsuccessful 2013 presidential petition.&ldquo;We are reflecting and reviewing what we have so far so as to see if we can make legal appeals on the basis of electoral fraud and misconduct,&rdquo; said Mr Orengo. He was referring to the sensational claims by Oloo, who served as the secretary general of The National Alliance (TNA), the party on whose ticket Uhuru and Ruto were elected in 2013. Last week, Oloo defected to ODM of Opposition leader Raila Odinga, who disputed his defeat by Uhuru in the last presidential vote.Orengo said it was impossible to use the current laws to remove the Jubilee government on these grounds, hence the only option was petitioning courts to have those who participated in the alleged malpractice blocked from participating in the coming elections.According to Orengo, if there are grounds for legal action, the Opposition will seek the intervention of the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC), the Directorate of Criminal Investigations (DCI) and the Director of Public Prosecution (DPP).

It is my prayer that Kenyans vote this con regime out of power. The hour of reckoning is in August,&rdquo; said Mudavadi.Suba MP and ODM chairman John Mbadi said: &ldquo;I thank Oloo and Sakaja for coming out boldly to confirm what our fears have been. In future, individuals involved in electoral fraud should not just confess but also be jailed for denying Kenyans their democratic wish and allowing them to be governed by default.&rdquo;However, Jubilee allied MPs in Kakamega led by Benjamin Washiali (Mumias East), Emmanuel Wangwe (Navakholo) and Bernard Shinali (Ikolomani) claimed Raila was using Oloo to lock out other aspirants for the Opposition presidential ticket.Speaking after attending a church service at Salvation Army in Kakamega town, Wangwe said sentiments by Oloo were schemes by Raila to lure voters on the premise that he won 2013 elections and he can still win 2017 elections.Some political leaders have called for the arrest and prosecution of Sakaja and Oloo for their role in the contested 2013 presidential elections.
