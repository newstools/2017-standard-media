KUJ will seek legal redress against such primitive acts and will launch campaigns for media blackouts against politicians using violence on the messengers as their campaign tools,&rdquo; said KUJ Secretary General Eric Oduor.&ldquo;Journalists have no role in political rivalries between Dr Kidero and his opponents and, therefore, their safety must be guaranteed by the organisers of the political rallies,&rdquo; he added.On his side, Governor Kidero condemned the attack as &ldquo;a primitive and undemocratic act that denies the media and Kenyans free speech. It is a wrong signal with Seven months to the election.&rdquo; ALSO READ: Peter Kenneth warns against Jubilee infightingKidero requested police to investigate and bring culprits to book.&ldquo;Why do my rivals fear and resort to violence?
