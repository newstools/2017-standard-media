(Photo: Collins Oduor/Standard)A six-week-old infant spent Friday night in the cold at Kisumu County&#39;s Holo town following a botched abduction. Baby Vincy was found abandoned on a slab at a nursery school 200 metres from his home by Margaret Agola, who was on an early morning trip to a nearby river.Eunice Akoth, his mother, said she arrived home from work as a waiter at a restaurant at 9pm on Friday with her baby. Since he was already asleep, she lay him on the bed and left for the market to shop for groceries.&quot;I knew should the baby wake up and start crying while away, one of my neighbours would attend to him,&quot; she said.She met Beatrice Akinyi and her 17-year old cousin Christine Awino at the gate. Akinyi&#39;s mother, Monica Anyango, had been her neighbour until Thursday when she moved out. But when she returned about 20 minutes later, she found her door wide open and the baby missing. She immediately reported the matter to the Department of Children&#39;s Services in West Kisumu Ward who launched a hunt for the two girls.Three hours later, Christine was arrested. She confessed that Beatrice, who works for the National Youth Service (NYS) in Nairobi and has been married three times but is childless, had stolen the baby.The police are looking for Beatrice who is still missing. Her mother, Monica, reportedly called and warned her not come home with the stolen baby. Both Monica and Christine are in custody.&nbsp;
