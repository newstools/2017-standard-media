A man has sued Attorney General Githu Muigai and Director of Public Prosecutions Keriako Tobiko for wrongful arrest and prosecution. In his suit papers before a Kakamega court, Gregory Shisia stated that on February 22, 2009, he and two others were falsely arrested and charged with the murder of one Peter Tomia based on &#39;false&#39; information by a chief.&nbsp;&quot;The area chief and officers from Mumias police post, without conducting any investigations or hearing my side of the story, arrested me and two others then separately held me in Mumias police post. The other two were also held in different locations,&quot; he says. Shisia says he was denied communication to anyone and that after being held for two weeks, he was released for lack of evidence.He would be rearrested and charged on November 12, 2009 with murder. He was acquitted on February 10 last year by the High Court in Kakamega, which ruled he had no case to answer. &quot;I suffered bodily harm and mental torture,&quot; he says.
