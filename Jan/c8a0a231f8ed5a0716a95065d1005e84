CS Fred Matiang&#39;i cracks whip on CUE over rot in universities, a tough-talking Dr Matiang&rsquo;i blames the commission for what he describes as deteriorating status of university education in the country.The commission now has until end of January to clear the mess by providing data on students&rsquo; qualifications, management of students&rsquo; records, the size of classes and guidelines for administration of the various academic programmes. In a letter obtained by The Standard from Matiang&rsquo;i addressed to CUE Chairman Chacha Nyaigoti Chacha dated December 22, 2016, Matiang&rsquo;i detailed how the commission had left the sector unregulated.&ldquo;Concerns, complaints, petitions and representations reaching my office suggest all is not well within the public and private universities in Kenya,&rdquo; wrote Matiang&rsquo;i.He said he had reports that some universities were not adhering to the legal framework for university education, and, more specifically, the set standards and guidelines.

Have any unqualified students been admitted to or awarded degree or diplomas in the past five years?&rdquo; writes the CS.The CS also wants security audit reports of all universities and a report on the Biometric Identification Systems, which he says are long overdue.In November 2016, the CS had ordered closure of 11 campuses affiliated&nbsp; to Kabarak, Kisii and Laikipia universities, citing concerns on standards.
