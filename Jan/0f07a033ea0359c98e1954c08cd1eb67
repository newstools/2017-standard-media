Tanzania&rsquo;s energy regulator has approved a power tariff hike of 8.53 percent by the state-run utility, less than half of what the utility said it needed to stem losses.The Tanzania Electric Supply Company (TANESCO) had sought an 18.19 percent tariff increase to snap a loss-making trend and clear debts to independent power producers and fuel suppliers. The tariff hike takes effect from January 1, the Energy and Water Utilities Regulatory Authority (EWURA) said in a statement on Saturday. &ldquo;The proposed tariff increase intends to cover TANESCO&rsquo;s cost of operation and fund its capital investment programme,&rdquo; said the regulator. &ldquo;The increase will also enable TANESCO to demonstrate its bankability to donors offering concessionary loans or grants.&rdquo;The regulator said the average tariff would now be increased from 242.34 Tanzania shillings ($0.1114) per kilo-watt hour to 263.02 shillings/kwh. The cash-strapped public utility has been seeking loans from the World Bank, the African Development Bank (AfDB) and commercial lenders to turn around the company and return to profitability.
