Hopes to end the ongoing impasse between doctors and the Government were yesterday crushed after the medics declined an offer they were given.The offer that Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu said was unanimously agreed on at a meeting that started at 6am yesterday, would have seen doctors elevated to the next job group.This was per the demands tabled by the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) officials led by chairman Samuel Oroko. Yesterday evening, CS Mailu, however, revealed that after meeting the union officials at 6am to discuss &#39;what offer could make them instruct their members to go back to work&#39;, the union listed several demands.Among them was that the offer given by President Uhuru Kenyatta that increased their salaries by 40 per cent should stay and be made effective starting January 2017.The medics also want a new risk allowance of Sh10,000 and a 100 per cent increment of call allowance from Sh30,000 to Sh66,000.

All they said is that they will be getting in touch on Friday,&quot; said Mailu.However, the doctors&#39; officials are expected to be sent to jail tomorrow and they have already vowed not to continue with talks if this happens.&quot;It is up to them to choose the right representative to come and conclude the talks. As for us, we are still willing to engage them,&quot; said Mailu.
