There are 21 counties that have been greatly hit. Addressing the media in his office, Nguma said the drought had affected both humans and animals in parts of Kilifi North sub-county, Ganze, Bamba, Kaloleni and Magarini.&quot;The ongoing drought has really hit us. This has caused a food shortage and forced people to walk long distances in search of water because the boreholes are dry. The animals are dying for lack of pasture,&quot; he said, adding that so far no people had been reported dead.&nbsp;Nguma said the county government was working with other stakeholders, including the national government through the National Government Relief Food Programme, to contain the situation.
