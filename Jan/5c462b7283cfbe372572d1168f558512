President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s assurance that the August 7 General Election will be free and fair offers a ray of hope at a time when skepticism clouds the political arena.While the President&#39;s New Year promise will have to be validated with real action, it will calm the waters at a time when politicians have been sounding the war drums. The aspersions that the Opposition and other political players have cast on the credibility of this year&#39;s elections is not an isolated Kenyan problem.As a matter of fact, the angst and sense of dread pervading the country has lately been witnessed in the run-up to elections in many African countries.Yet this should not be the case, because elections, especially when credible and transparent are the hallmark of true democracy and a process of political transition.

By the same token, the Government must desist from dismissing concerns about the integrity of polls offhand.It should be honest enough to acknowledge challenges in past elections and ensure they are addressed before the next polls.To be sure, given our winner-takes-it-all, there is bound to be vicious campaigns.But this must not turn to violence; the campaigns can be and should be peaceful.The President must lead the way and everyone must play their part to ensure those who fear a breakout of electoral violence are proved wrong. This is because election violence serves to undermine free and fair process.

That is the way to go.There must free flow of information and consensus between the Government and the Opposition.This will arrest any misconception of any pre-planned rigging. It defused tensions over the disagreement around the exit of the current election commissioners.The same spirit of dialogue and consensus should not be discarded now for we need it more than ever.When elections are free, fair and transparent, everyone is bound to abide by the outcome.

In such instances, calls against the outcomes are easily defeated.While every leader has a responsibility to promote peace and hold the country together, the load is heavier on your shoulders, Mr President.You have the constitutional mandate to hold to country together.
