Nairobi County will start recruitment of new doctors this week to replace those on strike.The City government last week issued show cause letters to the approximately 124 doctors who had been taking part in the strike that commenced in December 2016. &ldquo;The doctors have not responded to our letters and we cannot force them to resume work. The hiring exercise will take place this week,&rdquo; said Governor Evans Kidero.The letters, seeking to know why the doctors should not be fired for absconding duty and participating in the strike, were signed by County Secretary Robert Ayisi.Speaking in Nairobi, Kidero highlighted patient&#39;s suffering as a result of the strike saying that &ldquo;enough is enough&rdquo;.

Anyone that does not resume work should know that they stand sacked,&rdquo; said Dr Kidero.He said the county had already taken disciplinary action against doctors by not paying them their December salaries. He confirmed that only 54 doctors had resumed work across all county hospitals.&ldquo;Why pay someone for a job they have not done? We will not pay them and we will by Friday sack them and employ other doctors,&rdquo; warned Kidero.He defended the county&#39;s action of not paying the doctors their December salary, saying the county was obeying the court order that declared the strike illegal.Ayisi said the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that the medics were quoting in their pay hike demands was illegal as it had not been registered with the courts.&ldquo;If the doctors do not come for their letters, we shall post them to their last known addresses,&rdquo; he added.Nairobi County Health Executive Benard Muia said that the county had already advertised for the doctors positions.
