Default on loans touched record levels last year, prompting banks to adopt stringent lending conditions including mandatory credit information.Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) data showed banks increased requests for credit information by over 100 per cent last year, in a year where more Kenyans have been blacklisted for defaulting in paying their loans.Bad loans hit Sh207 billion by the third quarter last year, the highest ever in the country&rsquo;s financial history attributed to tighter loan classifications enforced by new CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge as well as company layoffs and business cash flow constraints. According to the Central Bank&rsquo;s financial statements, bank credit report requests jumped from three million in 2015 to six million, a 107 per cent jump, while micro-finance banks doubled from 176,619 to 294,813.&ldquo;The credit information sharing mechanism remained a key input in the decision-making process of credit providers in Kenya as they sought to mitigate risks associated with information asymmetry,&rdquo; Central Bank said.The report covers June 2015 to June 2016, long before President Uhuru Kenyatta signed the rate capping into law, which made banks more restive to lending and credit reports even more crucial.
