Governor Wycliffe Oparanya has maintained that Western Kenya is not ready to field a presidential candidate in this year&#39;s General Election.The governor, who is also the Orange party deputy leader, said voter apathy and lack of numerical strength has always worked to the disadvantage of the community and the region. Speaking at Buchenya grounds in Butere on Saturday, Mr Oparanya said the paltry 1.4 million Luhya votes were negligible.&quot;President Uhuru Kenyatta garnered more than eight million votes to win the 2013 polls and it is misleading for one to think that our insignificant votes could guarantee a person from Western a chance for the presidency,&quot; he said. He told residents to rally behind the Opposition alliance that would be agreed on by all leaders, be it the National Super Alliance (Nasa) or CORD.
