There is also the controversial verification of registration as specified in the elections bill, auditing of the voter register and procurement of equipment.Already, Auditor General Edward Ouko has queried the Sh7.3 billion used to buy equipment in 2013, which is now obsolete and now IEBC wants Sh9 billion to buy new ones.The appointment of IEBC and Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission bosses plus their swearing in is another major event.Parliament holds the key to unlocking this deadlock as Kenyans wait to know the new commissioners of&nbsp; IEBC and the chairman as well as EACC chairman.President Kenyatta has nominated former Anglican Church of Kenya Archbishop Eliud Wabukala to chair EACC and has forwarded his name to Parliament for vetting.National Assembly Speaker Justin Muturi committed Dr Wabukala&rsquo;s nomination to the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee chaired by Ainabkoi MP Samuel Chepkonga for vetting before tabling a report in the House for adoption or rejection.The term for the Micah Cheserem-led Commission on Revenue Allocation expired last year. Both Houses of Parliament have now approved the nomination of seven commissioners to CRA. Uhuru will now have to appoint one of the nominees to chair the commission. They include Edward Oyugi, Peter Njeru, Kishanto Suuji, Irene Asienga, Fouzia Dahir, Humprey Wattanga and Peter Kiko Kimuyu.
