The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission has revealed that there are a total of 128,926 records of shared registration documents.This came following a host of claims that several individuals had discovered they shared Identification numbers with other Kenyans. The latest case indicated that CORD leader Raila Odinga shared ID card number with a woman, an anomaly which has since been rectified.IEBC Chair Wafula Chebukati said that these cases of multiple registrations are attributed to data entry errors at the time of registration, possible use of one ID to register more than once, attempted registration of more than one person using same ID as well as shared National ID numbers. &ldquo;The Commission is working closely with National Registration Bureau (NRB) to clean up all the shared IDs.&nbsp; In addition, a team of Registration officers and ICT operators are conducting further cleanup,&rdquo; said Chebukati.He said that the provisional register will be availed to members of the public for verification once the voter enlistment exercise is over.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Now MPs should step forward and stand in the gap for Kenya
