The Kenya Human Rights Commission (KHRC) could be grounded following an explosive report that recommends freezing of its bank accounts.An investigative report prepared by the NGOs-Coordination Board has accused KHRC of massive irregularities ranging from tax evasion and operating illegal bank accounts. As a consequence, the board has recommended that all bank accounts belonging to the commission be frozen and an investigation file opened.&ldquo;Because of the existence of the numerous illegal bank accounts operated by KHRC, the Central Bank of Kenya should be advised to freeze the following bank accounts until they are regularised in accordance with the existing financial legal framework: National Industrial Credit Bank Ltd, NIC Bank Masaba Road Branch and Commercial Bank of Africa,&rdquo; the board concluded.Current officials and directors of KHRC include Prof Makau Mutua, Betty Murungi, Atsango Chesoni, Davis Malombe, Karuti Kanyinga, Davinder Lamba, Fr Gabriel Dolan, George Kegoro, Muthoni Wanyeki and Godwib Murunga.
