Chiefs must ensure those who require national identification cards are issued with the crucial documents immediately,&rdquo; said Ruto. Responding to complaints from locals that they were being forced to offer bribes by some members of the provincial administration, the DP ordered Muktar Abdi, Kericho&rsquo;s County Commissioner, to investigate the matter and take action against the culprits.&ldquo;The government will not tolerate anyone who frustrates ordinary Kenyans seeking to acquire the crucial document,&rdquo; said Ruto.At Litein town junction Ruto, who was accompanied by Energy Cabinet Secretary Charles Keter among other senior Rift Valley leaders, gave the CS a two-week ultimatum to launch a street electrification project.
