Jubilee Party has launched a smart card to eliminate fraud in registration of members.The card will also be used in the nomination exercise and has a unique bar code that is machine verifiable. It captures a member&#39;s name, national identity card number and telephone number.To ensure supporters are duly registered as members and registered voters, the card is connected to the database of the Registrar of Political Parties and that of the Independent, Electoral and Boundaries Commission.All party members who would wish to participate in the nomination exercise must, therefore, acquire the smart card.
