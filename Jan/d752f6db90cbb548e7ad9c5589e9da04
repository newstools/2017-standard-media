Turkana County leadership has expressed fury over Deputy President William Ruto&#39;s two-day visit in the area saying he failed to address the real demands of the locals and instead turned to discredit the &lsquo;otherwise excellent devolution progress.&rsquo;In a press statement, Governor Josphat Nanok claimed that Ruto bypassed the county leadership in planning his tour which was meant to urge more citizens to register as voters but turned out to be a Jubilee Party campaign rally.&ldquo;It cannot go unnoticed that the DP who overlooked the intergovernmental framework of coordination and consultation between the two levels of government kept Turkana County Government in the dark on his visitation, and utilised every opportunity to address the public to launch scathing attacks on my leadership,&rdquo; stated Nanok. The governor termed Ruto&#39;s visit a political campaign to lure the locals to support Jubilee party, which he said had failed to prioritise the needs of the locals, saying the DP even falsely took credit of some county government projects to defend the ruling coalition&#39;s track record.He pointed out that the DP&#39;s itinerary included visits to county funded health and water projects but without the courtesy of informing or inviting the host government.&ldquo;His unwarranted attack on my leadership is malicious and aimed at installing weaker leaders to our people whom he can easily manipulate and comfortably plunder our resources. He failed to give a satisfactory answer on the pertinent question of division of oil benefits through the proposed amendment of the Petroleum Bill 2016,&rdquo; added Nanok.
