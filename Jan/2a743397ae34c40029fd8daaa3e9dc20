We have also lost our livestock and that is why we want the Government to move with speed and restore peace in this area.&quot;He added; &quot;People have abandoned their farms and fled to other areas. We need a long-lasting solution to end the cattle rustling menace now,&quot; Kinur said yesterday.Linah Kitum, said she lost her brother in-law during one of the many attacks and accused the government of neglecting them.
