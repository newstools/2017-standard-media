Some 89 parents whose children sat KCPE exams at Nyali Primary School have moved to court seeking re-tallying of marks.They filed a petition at the Mombasa Law Courts claiming the marks awarded to their children did not reflect their ability or the school&#39;s general performance. They filed their petition through Jengo and associates advocates claiming they could prove that there was general inaccuracy in the tallying of marks, which affected the integrity of the process.Kenya National Examination Council (Knec) is the key respondent in the petition. The parents want the marked examination scripts checked for validity, reliability and accuracy.&quot;We are seeking the above to ensure transparency and accountability in the process,&quot; the parents said in court documents.
