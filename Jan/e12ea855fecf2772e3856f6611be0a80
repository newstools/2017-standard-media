More than 100 cameras and audio recorders are being distributed by the National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) to monitor politicians. Irene Wanyoike, the commission&#39;s vice chairperson, said due to rising political temperatures, NCIC would monitor those who were propagating hatred. She said the commission was working closely&nbsp;with security agencies including the National Intelligence Service to arrest and tame politicians engaging in hate speech. &quot;The commission has already acquired equipment to be given to our staff and police to record speeches at political rallies and meetings organised by both sides of the political divide,&quot; Ms Wanyoike said in Nyeri. She said the equipment would be used to collect evidence to tighten legal cases against hatemongers. &quot;All counties have proved to be hotspots because of agitation for political seats created by devolution. Gubernatorial&nbsp; and MCA contests are coming across as the most competitive and have caused tension in all regions,&quot; she said. The NCIC also wants to be involved in vetting candidates contesting various positions. &quot;This will enable us to lock out anyone making tribal remarks and inciting communities to war at public rallies,&quot; she said, adding that it would be good if NCIC were given the power to clear candidates vying for elective positions.
