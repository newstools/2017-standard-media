Kenya congratulates him on a race well won. We pledge to work with him to defend the Pan-African agenda of integration for Africa, as well as democracy, sovereignty and prosperity for all of its people,&quot; said the statement signed by State House Spokesman Manoah Esipisu.Amina lost the race despite intense lobbying by President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto.The new AU boss will replace South African Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma who is departing after completing her four-year tenure.Kenya also ceded the deputy chairman&#39;s position that was in the hands of Erastus Mwenja to a candidate from Ghana. Mwenja&#39;s term had lapsed.Earlier, President Uhuru had held talks with 10 African leaders in last-minute lobbying for the election of Amina.Given the unpredictability of the vote, Uhuru on Sunday night held talks with Presidents Jacob Zuma of South Africa, Hage Geingob of Namibia, Paul Kagame of Rwanda,&nbsp;Ethiopia&#39;s Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn and Patrice Trovoada, Prime Minister of S&atilde;o Tom&eacute; and Pr&iacute;ncipe.Others were Yoweri Museveni of Uganda, Nana Akufo-Addo of Ghana, Burkina Faso&#39;s leader Roch Marc Christian Kabor&eacute; and Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt.
