(Photo: Denish Ochieng/ Standard)In one of the few Form One admission hitches reported so far, 80 extra names have appeared on admissions list of one of the county&rsquo;s best schools. Lwak Girls&rsquo; High School principal Anastacia Amollo said she had been directed to admit 360 students according to a list generated by the Ministry of Education after the Form One selection exercise, instead of the school&rsquo;s maximum capacity of 280.The school is now grappling with the possibility of admitting more students than it can accommodate, as the head teacher said she had no idea where to put the extra students.&ldquo;Lwak Girls is a six-stream school and the maximum number that should have been allocated to us was 280. The 360 who have admission letters as we speak can best be accommodated in an eight-stream school,&rdquo; said Sr Anastacia.

We sent the reports on schools as late as November and that should have guided the number of students being selected to join various schools in the republic,&rdquo; said Chepkawai.The nationwide Form One admissions, which kicked off yesterday, saw enthusiastic parents and students begin reporting to the school as early as 6am.In all the other schools visited by The Standard team, admissions went on smoothly, with teachers and parents taking their time to ensure that the new students met all the admission requirements.&ldquo;Students are reporting with materials they bought from their preferred shops,&rdquo; said Hellen Juma, the principal of Sinyolo Girls&rsquo; High School.
