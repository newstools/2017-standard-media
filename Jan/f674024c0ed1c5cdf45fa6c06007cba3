More than 5,000 students have not reported to school for first term for fear of sporadic attacks by bandits along the border of West Pokot and Elgeyo Marakwet counties.Two weeks after schools opened, eight schools and early childhood education centres in Chesogon Division, Pokot Central Sub-county still remain closed, following the insecurity. Some of the affected schools include Cheptulel Girls, Cheptulel Boys, Arpollo, Sapulmoi, Chesogon, Tirap and Charatak primary schools.Kenya National Union of Teachers (Knut) West Pokot branch executive secretary Martin Sembelo said about 20,000 people, including vulnerable women and children on the insecurity-prone border, have been displaced, following the banditry attacks that have been going on for months.Speaking to the press in Kapenguria, Mr Sembelo said residents are affected by starvation and most of them are living in caves and bushes while others have migrated from the region altogether.

He urged education stakeholders to join the peace process and ensure normalcy returns in the region.Lomut MCA Hellen Madio accused the government for failing in its duty to provide security. Madio urged residents to identify criminals causing mayhem in the area so that they can be prosecuted.Parents say they will not allow their children to go to school if the insecurity problem is not addressed.However, speaking to The Standard on Saturday on the phone, Pokot Central Deputy County Commissioner Geoffrey Kithinji said schools have reopened, although the number of children going to school has dropped.Kithinji said the government is mobilising children to go back to school and is also providing security to the learners and teachers.&ldquo;We are trying our level best to ensure no school is closed because of insecurity. Security officers are on high alert to maintain peace,&rdquo; he said.
