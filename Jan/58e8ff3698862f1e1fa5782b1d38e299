Royal Media Services owner SK Macharia, on Wednesday&nbsp;revived a 10-year dispute that plunged the country into chaos when he told the Senate&rsquo;s Legal Affairs committee that former Prime Minister Raila Odinga won the 2007 presidential election.And the reaction from former President Mwai Kibaki was swift as he appeared rattled by the claims. Mr Macharia claimed he had evidence to back his claims that Raila won but did not substantiate his allegations during his submission on the contentious Election (Amendment) Bill.Kibaki&rsquo;s advisor, Marangu Marete, dismissed the media mogul, saying his utterances were careless.&ldquo;In his submission on manual backup to the Senate earlier today (yesterday), SK Macharia made preposterous allegations to the effect that Raila Odinga won the 2007 duel... Macharia further claimed he has evidence which he, apparently in his wisdom or lack thereof, didn&rsquo;t present before the Johann Kriegler Commission,&rdquo; said Prof Marete.

We tracked all the results through satellite phones and as per my records, Raila won the elections,&rdquo; Macharia told the senators when he gave a historical perspective of why elections in Kenya are disputed.He also said his media house conducted a parallel tallying of votes from all polling stations in the country, where statistics showed that Raila emerged the victor.He urged the committee to take a key interest in resolving the shortcomings that have resulted in election conflicts as is the case in the debate about the electronic voting system.Committee chairman Amos Wako praised Macharia, who appeared before the team on behalf of the Media Owners Association, for speaking candidly on past happenings, which he was part of as the Attorney General at the time.
