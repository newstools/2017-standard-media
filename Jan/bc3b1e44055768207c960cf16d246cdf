Four days after the release of the shocker Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education (KCSE) 2016 exam results, focus now turns to tomorrow&rsquo;s re-opening of schools, with a raft of radical changes awaiting the sector.It was the first time in 27 years that the examination results were announced the same year they were done. Furthermore, the security and surveillance associated with the exams and spearheaded by reformist Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i had never been witnessed before. The same case was seen with the Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) exams, which was also released early - on December 1, 2016, within a notice of 45 minutes.After overseeing one of the most successful examination processes, Dr Matiang&#39;i faces his next battle: ensuring that school fee guidelines are adhered to.As usual when schools re-open, parents and guardians are faced with the menace of increased fees against their empty pockets yet to be replenished following the expensive Christmas holidays.

I wish to put Board of Management (BoM) of schools that charge extra fees on notice that once we confirm any such illegalities, appropriate disciplinary action shall be meted out,&quot; said the CS.BIG PLANAnd as part of the Jubilee government&#39;s big plan to increase access to education to all Kenyans, the CS said starting this year, the Government would extend payment of exam fees to all candidates sitting exams in private schools in Kenya.&quot;I, however, wish to warn schools against registering &quot;ghost&quot; candidates with the intention of inflating their candidature to the levels that Knec requires of an examination centre,&quot; said Matiang&#39;i.

We have to take the results of each examination administered seriously and seek to analyse the lessons we draw from them.&quot;The CS explained that the reforms would boost the Government&#39;s concerted efforts to deliver an examination process that was beyond reproach; one that would enable our graduates to walk briskly in the global arena.
