Jubilee Party (JP) yesterday formally launched a massive voter listing strategy through a smart card device that will be used to register and track voters.The event, which also served as a platform for President Kenyatta and Deputy President William Ruto to enumerate Jubilee achievements, was one of a kind. It saw the dissolution of the recently formed presidential campaign team, which comprised a few elected leaders. The move was meant to dispel fear among aspirants that the Jubilee administration had preferred candidates. Jubilee insiders and strategists believe the situation would stand in the way of efficient recruitment of party members because those who fear going through the nominations would push voters to register in parties where aspirants feel safer.The Standard on Saturday established that the decision to dismantle the presidential campaign team and instead have one that includes all aspirants was taken by President Kenyatta earlier last week. He placed a call to the team&rsquo;s head, Raphael Tuju, and directed him to abolish the team. He told Tuju that all aspirants are members of his campaign team.The decision, insiders say, was reached after a convergence of formal and informal intelligence that some members of the presidential campaign team had taken advantage of their appointment to the detriment of their opponents.

That is not enough, we want all Jubilee members to join this team,&rdquo; said Ruto.His remarks came minutes after Kiambu Governor William Kabogo took to the podium and told the DP that aspirants were apprehensive about members of the campaign team because they were creating the impression of being preferred candidates by the JP leadership.The party has adopted a unique strategy completely away from the line of thinking that characterised the 2013 primaries.In the next one week, committees at the county, constituency and ward levels will be formed across the country.The primary role of the committees, whose composition will be in consultation with all aspirants, will be to monitor, spearhead and keep records of registered party members to ensure they are all registered as voters.
