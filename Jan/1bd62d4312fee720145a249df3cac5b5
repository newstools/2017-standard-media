Mary Gathoni Maina saunters into the consultation room followed by her husband Richard Maina at the Texas Cancer Centre in Nairobi.Ms Gathoni is battling cancer of the colon, which was diagnosed in April last year back in their home in Karatina, Nyeri County. She was referred to Kenyatta National Hospital (KNH) where she was put on treatment and attended four chemotherapy sessions after every three weeks before doctors went on strike.The last chemotherapy session she had was on November 28, before the doctors went on strike in the beginning of December. &quot;I was to go to Kenyatta Hospital on December 2 but when we called, we were informed that there were no doctors and we had to find an alternative,&quot; she says.

The latest in their tribulations was in a hospital in Karatina where she was asked to buy medicine worth Sh20, 000 only for them to be told that the hospital could not administer the medicine forcing them to come rush to Nairobi &ndash; again.&quot;We had to leave very early before daybreak to get here early and join the queue for treatment,&quot; says Maina.At the cancer treatment hospital was another 65-year-old whose family brought in for treatment.
