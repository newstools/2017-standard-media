Jubilee Party suffered a blow in Embu after one of the major contenders for the gubernatorial seat decamped to the Party of National Unity (PNU).Former Transport Permanent Secretary Cyrus Njiru said he changed his mind about vying for governorshipnon a Jubilee ticket following endless leadership rows that have rocked the county. Mr Njiru claimed election of JP interim leaders was marred by infighting and hooliganism, a situation worsened by leaders from the county who have split into two parallel interim committees creating further confusion.&quot;While I support the Jubilee government for the things they are doing for the country, I decided to steer clear of the fighting at the Embu JP office. I am a peace-loving man thus I opted to quit,&quot; he said.Speaking at Kangaru market while mobilising youths to register as voters, Njiru described PNU as a political vehicle known for unity, which under President Mwai Kibaki achieved great milestones for Kenya.
