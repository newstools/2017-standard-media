Striking doctors were yesterday offered an enhanced pay package at a meeting with President Uhuru Kenyatta, but they sought more time to consider it.In the proposal, the entry point of doctors was enhanced from Job Group L to M, and salaries raised to Sh196,000, from the current Sh140,244. However, the doctors did not immediately take up the offer as the officials of Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union asked for more time before giving a conclusive answer on Friday.It means that the crippling month-long nationwide strike will go on, contrary to expectations that a solution was to be found yesterday.The President took charge of the high-powered negotiation attended by Cabinet Secretaries Henry Rotich (Treasury), Cleopa Mailu (Health), Salaries and Remuneration Commission chairperson Sarah Serem and the chairperson of the Public Service Commission Margaret Kobia.
