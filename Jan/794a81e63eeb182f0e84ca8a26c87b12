Japan&#39;s space agency on Sunday failed to send a satellite into orbit aboard an experimental mini-rocket due to communication failure. The modified sounding rocket SS-520, to be one of the world&#39;s smallest rockets to put an object in orbit, took off at 8:33 a.m. (2333GMT) on Sunday from the Uchinoura Space Center in Japan&#39;s southwestern Kagoshima Prefecture.However, the ignition of the second stage was aborted soon after a glitch was discovered in its communication system and data showing the rocket&#39;s condition could no longer be received, said the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in a press release.The rocket, with its payload, fell into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Uchinoura, said JAXA.
