Former adherents of the outlawed Mungiki sect are unwilling to register as voters, fearing it could be used as a ploy to arrest them. The former Mungiki members from Murang&#39;a said the police could secretly obtain their fingerprints and intimidate them. But speaking during a voter mobilisation forum in Kahuro, County Commissioner Vincent Kirui said details captured by IEBC are purely for electoral purposes. &quot;The Government is aware that many of the former sect members have reformed,&quot; said Mr Kirui. He said most of the youth have been registering as voters immediately they obtain their identity cards in line with the latest Government policy on registration period which has been reduced to three days.
