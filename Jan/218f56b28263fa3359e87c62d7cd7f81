NAIROBI, KENYA: With limited capability to manage the growing complexity and sophistication of IT security, small and medium businesses in the region are especially vulnerable.Security firm now says it is inspired to come up with a special training and incentive initiative for channel partners designed to enable them address small and medium businesses as a focus for their go-to-market activities.&nbsp; Speaking on the new initiative, Mr. Harish Chib, vice president, Middle East and Africa, Sophos said, &ldquo;With the growing volume of sophisticated and targeted threats across the world, small businesses without dedicated security resources are particularly challenged to stay secure. They often do not have adequate skilled security staff on board and have invested more on managing business challenges than on IT security infrastructure.&nbsp; The strategy of adding layer upon layer of security technologies is really no longer practical or effective. It is costly and complex and out of reach for a vast majority of businesses. Hence, we felt it is important to cater to this segment.&rdquo;&ldquo;Our intention is to help incentivize our channel partners to better serve and support our customers in this market segment with security knowledge and expertise,&rdquo; Mr. Chib added.The primary objective of the Sophos partner program is to equip partners with training and resources that enable them to sell, market, distribute and implement the company&rsquo;s award-winning cloud, network, server and end-user protection solutions to organizations of all sizes. It provides access to the company&rsquo;s portfolio of market-leading endpoint and network security products, which have been engineered keeping its partners in mind. &nbsp;
