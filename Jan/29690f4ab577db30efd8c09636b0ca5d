Governor Nderitu Gachagua will not be stepping aside after his term ends. Rumours have been circulating that the governor will not defend his seat in the August 8 polls so he can focus on his health.The rumours came in the wake of growing disquiet about Mr Gachagua&rsquo;s whereabouts. The governor has not been seen in public for over two months now. But yesterday, his deputy, Samuel Wamathai, assured residents that Gachagua would defend his seat.Wamathai accused Gachagua&rsquo;s rivals in the race for the county&rsquo;s top job of fabricating rumours about the governor to gain traction in their campaigns. &ldquo;Gachagua is not out of the race &mdash; he will defend his seat. People are spreading propaganda but none of that will deter him from recapturing his seat on August 8,&rdquo; he said.The governor&rsquo;s last public appearance was at a meeting of Jubilee Party aspirants in the county&nbsp;in November.Since then, his deputy has been at the helm of the county, officiating political engagements and public meetings including Mashujaa and Jamuhuri days.WIDESPREAD SPECULATIONAs the country gears up for an intense electioneering period, Gachagua&rsquo;s camp has been quiet about his bid to recapture his seat, fanning widespread speculation that he might choose to withdraw from the race.And in Isiolo, Senator Mohammed Kuti has finally broken his long silence and announced that he will vie for the governorship in the August elections.Dr Kuti, a two-term Isiolo North MP and Cabinet minister in retired President Mwai Kibaki&rsquo;s government, was among leaders who rallied the region behind the defunct United Republican Party to win four seats in the 2013 polls.He did not however state what party he would use as a vehicle to run in this year&rsquo;s polls.&ldquo;That decision will be made later,&rdquo; he said, adding that he would unveil his political line-up in the coming days.Kuti&rsquo;s entry in the race for the county&rsquo;s top seat is expected to change the political equation in the region.The incumbent, Godana Doyo, has announced that he will be defending his seat, which has also attracted his main rival in 2013, Abdul Bahari, Deputy Governor Mohammed Guleid, businessman Hussein Golicha, former NGO official Adan Kabelo and Anwar Kassam, a Kenyan-born Indian.
