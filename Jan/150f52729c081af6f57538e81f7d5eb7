The late Jaramogi Oginga Odinga&#39;s family is mourning the death of Mark Too. The former nominated MP who died on New Year&#39;s eve is the man who literally lit up their lives.The Odinga family used to live in darkness in their rural home until&nbsp; &quot;Bwana Dawa&quot; (Mr Fix It) came along. Mr Too was nicknamed Bwana Dawa by fellow politicians for his uncanny ability to provide solutions to seemingly intractable political problems.But it was not only political problems that Too helped to resolve, as Jaramogi&#39;s family members now attest.The family had for long had no power in their rural home in Nyamira Bondo, Siaya County, despite Jaramogi being an influential political figure in the country.

Too had not attended Jaramogi&#39;s burial due to unavoidable circumstances.&quot;It was shocking because my father had been a Vice President, and nobody would have expected that his home would not have electricity. But this was not his wish,&quot; said Oburu.According to Mr Oburu, the nearest power connection to Jaramogi&#39;s home was 6km away in Bondo town. And with Jaramogi being in the Opposition, most of the Government goodies never went his way, which made it difficult for him to access power.&quot;My father was not a person who would take advantage of the public resources for his personal benefit, hence it took him time before he could connect power at his home, and eventually he died before accomplishing that,&quot; said Oburu.According to Oburu, even though Too was a close ally of President Moi, who had differed with Jaramogi politically, he was shocked that the country&#39;s first Vice President had no power in his home, nor a good access road, and inquired if he could do something.&quot;He (Too) immediately took his phone and called the then President Daniel Moi and spoke with him briefly before getting back to me. He told&nbsp; me that something would be done,&quot; said Oburu, adding that within one week, power had been connected. Later a tarmac road was built connecting Jaramogi&#39;s home to the Bondo-Usenge road.

He later became an opposition leader and served as Bondo MP.He died in 1994, and was buried at his Kang&#39;o Kajaramogi home in Nyamira.Oburu said Too, who died last week in Eldoret after a short illness, would have made a difference in the current political stalemate had he been given a chance.The MP noted that Too played a crucial role in the Kanu-Liberal Democratic Party merger, which saw Former Prime Minister Raila Odinga become Kanu Secretary General.&quot;He (Too) was trusted during political turmoil, and he knew how to approach everybody, however wild. That was the origin of his nickname &#39;Bwana Dawa&#39;. He will be missed in the country&#39;s political space,&quot; he added.Nyando MP Fred Outa yesterday challenged fellow politicians to emulate&nbsp; Too.&quot;The man knew no tribal boundaries, and would soberly stand up and champion public good and cohesion among even the sharply divided political opinions,&quot; said Outa.He added: &quot;I must admit that we have very few &#39;Toos&#39; in Kenya today, but the country must now stand and look beyond ethnic differences so as to nurture the values he stood for.&quot;
