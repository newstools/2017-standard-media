FORD-Kenya deputy party leader Boni Khalwale wants Cotu secretary general Francis Atwoli to keep off politics.The call came a week after Atwoli unveiled Musalia Mudavadi as Luhya spokesman. Speaking in Navakholo constituency Saturday, Khalwale accused Atwoli of dividing the Luhya community&#39;s politicians.&quot;We Luhya leaders are happy that he brought Mudavadi closer to the Luhya people who are strongly in the Opposition. He spoilt it when he used the event to discredit other Luhya leaders like Moses Wetang&#39;ula and I,&quot; he said.Khalwale said Atwoli twice failed to capture the Butere parliamentary seat and should therefore respect elected leaders.
