Court issues warrant of arrest against doctors&rsquo; union officials for not appearing for sentencing after they were found guilty of contempt.The development comes hot on heels of the national government efforts to engage the striking doctors in order to reach an agreement. A flurry of meetings has been held between the government and representatives of the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KMPDU) in continuing efforts to end the strike.This comes after Council of Governors Chairman Peter Munya and Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu told the medics to report to work by Wednesday and give room for constructive engagement. Failure to do so, they said, may lead them losing their jobs.&ldquo;Both governments, national and county, have given a reasonable deal to the doctors that they need to consider. We are calling on them to take the offer and resume work to avoid disciplinary action,&rdquo; said Mr Munya.
