An umbrella body for trade unions has urged President Uhuru Kenyatta not to assent to the controversial elections law.Trade Union Congress of Kenya (TUC-Ke) &ndash; a body representing civil servants, teachers and lecturers &ndash; yesterday warned that the rising political temperatures were a threat to the country&#39;s stability as the August 8 General Election approached. Addressing the media in Nairobi, TUC-Ke Secretary General Wilson Sossion and his Kenya University Staff Union (Kusu) counterpart Charles Mukhwaya asked Uhuru to engage CORD in seeking a bipartisan approach to the standoff.The officials said Uhuru should not sign the bill, adding that the union would only support free, fair and credible polls.

Areas not covered by mobile network can use satellite,&quot; he said.On Thursday, Jubilee used its numerical strength in the Senate to reject any changes to the Elections Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2015 that was bulldozed by Jubilee MPs in the National Assembly in a chaotic special sitting.The changes, which propose a manual backup to the electronic voting system, are now awaiting the President&#39;s signature.
