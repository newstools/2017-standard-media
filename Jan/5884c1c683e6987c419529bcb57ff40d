Malaysian hospital chain, Columbia Pacific Management, plans to scale up its investments in Kenya with the opening of Sh250 million outpatient facility in Nairobi.The group, operating in Kenya as Columbia Africa, said it is currently undertaking studies that would inform the investments that it would make in the country. This adds to a growing interest in Kenya&rsquo;s healthcare industry where investors have in the recent past made substantial investments expecting good returns with a growth in healthcare spending, especially among the middle class. Columbia Africa also said it is looking to tap into the multitudes of people who travel to Asian countries to seek medical treatment. Columbia Africa&nbsp;General Manager Dr Prasad Sumit said the Kenyan operation would leverage the group&rsquo;s international presence and technology to offer services in Kenya, reducing travel abroad for medical services. &ldquo;We have the technology as well as such services as telemedicine to allow patients to consult with specialised doctors at Columbia Asia Hospitals,&rdquo; he said.
