Here, I agree with the learned magistrate that the offence of robbery with violence was proved to the required standard,&rdquo; the judge ruled.&ldquo;Based on this doctrine of recent possession, the appellants were properly convicted of the offence of robbery with violence,&rdquo; he added.The judge said although the pistol was recovered eight months after the robbery, the two were unable to explain how they had acquired it.&ldquo;It followed that the burden fell upon the appellants to give a reasonable explanation as to how they came into possession of the gun, failure to which the trial court was justified in the ruling,&rdquo; he said.
