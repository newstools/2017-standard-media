The process of firing striking doctors has started, Council of Governors Chairman Peter Munya has said.The Meru governor said although county governments were in favour of doctors getting what they duly deserve, there were no funds to meet their demands. &quot;They (striking doctors) have a right just like everyone else. But we are beseeching them to resume services until such a time that the economy will be doing well to meet their needs,&quot; Mr Munya said at a Party of National Unity public rally in Nanyuki town yesterday.A tough-talking Munya also said the country will not be held to ransom by the doctors, who are agitating for a pay rise and have been instructed to take the necessary steps to replace workers who do not want to resume work. &quot;We beseech them, as their fathers, mothers, brothers and sisters to come back to work or go home!&quot; Munya stated amid cheers by residents who had thronged Central Park grounds.
