Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has dismissed calls by the Mt. Kenya Jubilee Youth Caucus to ditch her party and run for the Kirinyaga Senatorial seat.Karua vowed to soldier on with her quest to become the second governor for Kirinyaga County after August 2017 general elections and nothing short of that.She said her eyes are already focused on the gubernatorial position and wondered why the Caucus should dictate to her which elective position to go for. &#39;&#39;Kenya being a Democratic State gives those wishing to contest for any elective position the right to do so depending on one&#39;s wish on which seat to vie for and I wonder why this Caucus is trying to chart my political path and destiny,&#39;&#39; she said.The Caucus through its Secretary General Stephen Karanja and Chairman Linford Mutembei wants Karua to abandon her gubernatorial bid and leave it to former Devolution Cabinet Secretary Anne Waiguru.It also assured Karua of its full support and victory to the Senate should she agree to the proposal ahead of the party primaries.
