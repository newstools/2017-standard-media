Nurses are set to resume a nationwide strike on Wednesday after the Government disowned a deal it signed only a month ago.It has now emerged that the Treasury is yet to disburse monies meant for nurses&#39; allowances agreed upon in December last year.Nurses who have been in talks with the counties walked out of talks on Thursday evening on realising they won&#39;t be paid their dues. And the Council of Governors (CoG) appears to have thrown in the towel after frantically sending various letters to the Treasury asking for funds.The Standard on Saturday has learnt that the county chiefs have conceded that the State may have played both the counties and nurses.This is after the CoG wrote to the counties giving them a go-ahead to process this month&rsquo;s payroll that they had sought to delay until the funds are availed.

However, if we shall not receive our allowances by February 1, we shall return to industrial action,&rdquo; Panyako said.

The nurses will be joining doctors who have been on strike for two months now. Knun suspended its 10-day strike on December 14 last year following a truce reached with the national and county governments.This was after the county governments led by CoG Chair Peter Munya agreed to sign the recognition agreement in the presence of Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu.In the deal, Mailu was forced to amend some clauses to an earlier Sh7 billion duty resumption agreement rejected by the nurses.In the new agreement, the monetary benefit of a &lsquo;nursing service allowance&rsquo; of Sh20,000 for nurses in job group G to L and Sh15,000 for M and above was maintained.
