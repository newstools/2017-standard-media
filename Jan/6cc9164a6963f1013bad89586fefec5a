The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) has ordered fresh investigation into the New Year&rsquo;s Eve gun drama involving a tycoon and the sons of a slain drug baron.The directive follows claims the first probe on Mombasa business mogul Ali Badrudin Punjani and slain drug lord Ibrahim Abdalla Akasha&rsquo;s sons was compromised.Mr Punjani was secretly taken to court on Monday last week to plead to charges of affray (fighting in a public place that disturbs the peace), three days after Baktash Akasha, his younger brother Abdalla Ibrahim Akasha, Abdulsalam Akasha, and Indian national Vijaygiri Goswami were charged for the same crime. SHOTS FIREDThe integrity of this probe has been in doubt since the fight took place. During the brawl, in a club in Nyali, Mombasa, several shots were fired sending other revellers scampering for safety.There were initial claims that police were reluctant to charge some suspects due to their alleged ties with top civil servants on their payroll.

And this gun has, allegedly, been traced to a man who died 20 years ago.Meanwhile, disgruntled officers indicate some investigators in the matter have maintained inappropriate relations with some suspects to date, hindering a comprehensive probe.The DPP now feels the details of what transpired at the club have not been fully brought into account and all witnesses questioned.
