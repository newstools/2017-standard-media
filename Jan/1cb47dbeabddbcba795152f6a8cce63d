The Ministry of Health is planning to hire hundreds of workers to man the controversial Sh1 billion mobile clinics on a temporary basis.The ministry says it has secured funding from the World Bank to recruit staff on a two-year contract to work in the 100 clinics to be distributed in all 47 counties.Each county is set to get at least two container clinics. Afya House has called a meeting with county representatives to discuss modalities.In a letter seen exclusively by The Standard, Health Principal Secretary Nicholas Muraguri convened the meeting at the ministry headquarters this morning.APPROVAL TO RECRUIT ALSO READ: High expectations as government is set to meet striking doctorsDr Muraguri said the Public Service Commission (PSC) had already granted the ministry authority to proceed with the recruitments but in consultation with the counties.&ldquo;The PSC vide letter N PSC/EMC/7/ (25), PSC/7/1 (V) 3 dated October 2016 gave approval to this ministry to recruit health workers on contract terms for a period of two (2) years with funding from the World Bank to staff 100 clinics in the informal settlements,&rdquo; the letter dated January 26, 2017, stated.&ldquo;While granting the above approval, the PSC directed the recruitment be handled strictly in accordance with the guidelines with your participation. In view of the above, you are invited to a meeting to be held at Afya House on January 31 starting from 10am.&rdquo;The letter was copied to the chairmen of the County Public Board Forum, the Council of Governors (CoG) and the Intergovernmental Technical Relations Committee.Sources at CoG yesterday evening intimated that the counties were skeptical about the mandate of the national government in recruiting staff as this would be seen as usurping the powers of the counties since health was a devolved function.The procurement of the 100 40-metre containers that cost taxpayers Sh1 billion sparked controversy last year.Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu defended the procurement, saying his ministry signed a Sh1 billion deal with Estama Investments to supply 100 clinics to be installed in remote and slum areas.
