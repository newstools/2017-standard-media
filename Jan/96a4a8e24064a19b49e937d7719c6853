NAIROBI: Nurses have threatened to resume their strike in February if the government will not have paid them service allowance.Secretary General of the Kenya National Union of Nurses (KNUN) Seth Panyako made the announcement in Nairobi during a swearing in ceremony of new National Nurses Association of Kenya officials last Friday. &quot; I am hearing that it might not be paid; let anybody try and if we go out from February 1, we shall not come back until that CBA is completely negotiated signed and registered by the court,&quot; said Panyako. The nursing service allowance agreed between the government and the nurses stipulated that nurses will get between Sh15,000 and Sh20,000.He further said that health services in Kwale County will be paralysed as from Tuesday next week if a nurse who had been arrested for conducting an HIV test is not released.The arrest of Irene Orina, a nurse in Diani was instigated by the Kenya Medical Laboratory Technicians and Technologist Board (KMLTTB) for allegedly working as a laboratory technologist without registration.

There were elections in 2012 which were not considered credible, nor free and fair, according to Obengo.
