Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi will today start an extensive voter sensitisation tour of the western region dubbed &quot;Nasa Kura&quot;.He is expected to make whistle-stops in different towns in Vihiga, Siaya and Busia counties. The campaign is part of the ANC&#39;s leader&#39;s crusade to get about 1.8 million potential voters in the region to register and vote in the August elections.The &quot;Nasa kura&#39; campaign is also meant to popularise the National Super Alliance (NASA) opposition unity that Mudavadi has promoted.
