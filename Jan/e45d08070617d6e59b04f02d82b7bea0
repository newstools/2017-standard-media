Kenya has started a digital skills training programme to enable 1 million young people to secure freelance online work in the next year, in a bid to tackle the country&#39;s acute youth unemployment problem.Kenya has the highest rate of youth joblessness in East Africa, the World Bank said, with 17 percent of all young people eligible for work lacking jobs. Neighbouring Tanzania and Uganda have comparable rates of 5.5 and 6.8 percent respectively.There are now an estimated 40,000 Kenyans who have secured online work ranging from transcription services to software development on sites like Amazon&#39;s MTURK and the Kenyan-owned KuHustle platform. Joe Mucheru, the minister for information, communication and technology, said the digital jobs initiative aimed to boost that number to 1 million, using a partly government-funded programme called Ajira, or &quot;employment&quot; in Swahili.&quot;It is called the gig economy,&quot; he told Reuters, without saying how much the government was funding. &quot;Companies are actually putting work online because it is cheaper, it is efficient and it is better for them.&quot;Kenya has sought to promote itself as a tech hub for Africa. Its successes include pioneering work by Safaricom to build a mobile money payments system M-Pesa that can be used on the simplest devices and which has been mimicked abroad.

Gichuru plans to launch it in other African nations.Derrick Muturi, 25, started online work with KuHustle in 2013 and now runs a firm that employs four to develop livestock management apps for farmers and runs a website for meat deliveries.Muturi, an IT graduate who works from Nairobi&#39;s business incubation centre Nailab, said he was able to start a small business without hunting for capital, one of the biggest challenges for African entrepreneurs.&quot;Your capital is actually what you know, your experience and how good you are,&quot; he said.The government initiative mirrors one started by Google , which has trained half a million young Africans with digital skills and aims to create 1 million web-based jobs.
