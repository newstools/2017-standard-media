Governor Evans Kidero took his campaigns to&nbsp;Nyamira County where he urged local residents to influence their relatives in Nairobi to support his re-election.Speaking during the burial of Mzee Patrick Nyangau at Obwari market in Nyamira County, Dr Kidero appealed to members of the Gusii community to support his re-election bid.Kidero said during his four years in office as Nairobi governor he had sealed major loopholes for looting, and that was why corrupt people were fighting to remove him from office. Kidero said the Gusii cannot be ignored in Nairobi County politics because they contribute more than half of the county&#39;s economy.&quot;I want to let you know that your people have over 160,000 matatus operating within the city and many of them have also invested in real estate and therefore my administration cannot afford to ignore them,&quot; Kidero told the mourners.Kidero said he had fully incorporated the Gusii along other ethnic groups in his government, and given another term he would do more for them.
