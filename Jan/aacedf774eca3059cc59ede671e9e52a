Agriculture Cabinet Secretary Willy Bett has said a ground survey done by the ministry has revealed that the country has 21 million bags of maize.This is from both what the national reserve and what farmers are hoarding.&ldquo;Coupled with other grains like beans and rice, this can take us up to June if the current situation remains constant. But we are closely monitoring,&rdquo; said Bett.

I believe the price of Sh3, 000 a bag the government is offering is fair enough,&rdquo; argued Bett.Bett said the country currently requires 29 million bags which reveal a deficit of eight million bags. Kenya needs to produce at least 32 million bags to be food secure.&ldquo;Such deficit is what is usually covered with the short rains which this year, has been uneven causing the drought. If this persists, then we will have to employ different strategies but currently we are not looking into buying grains from neighbouring countries,&rdquo; said Bett.
