Primary school head teachers have warned that operations in schools are bound to ground if the Government delays further in releasing funds for the term.Kenya Primary School Heads Association (Kepsha) officials led by Chairman Shem Ndolo said the Government had pledged to release half of the funds but has not done so. &quot;The Government promised to send us 50 per cent of the money within the first week but up to now, there is nothing,&quot; said Mr Ndolo.He added that schools require the money urgently as they are admitting new pupils.&quot;We are admitting pupils yet there is no single penny that has been sent to us to run the schools,&quot; he added.
