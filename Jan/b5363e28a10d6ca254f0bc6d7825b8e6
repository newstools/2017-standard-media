US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May, who share an unusual bond as the products of anti-establishment uprisings, will sit down on Friday for what could be a difficult search for unity on NATO, Russia and trade.The meeting will mark Trump&rsquo;s first with a foreign leader since taking power a week ago, and it could go a long way toward determining how crucial Trump considers the traditional &ldquo;special relationship&rdquo; between the two countries.Trump rode an anti-Washington wave to win on November 8, and May gained power in July after the &quot;Brexit&quot; vote that has put her country on a path to separate from the European Union. The meeting will conclude with a joint White House news conference. Trump has declared NATO obsolete and expressed a desire for warmer ties with Russia. May considers the trans-Atlantic alliance crucial and is skeptical of Russian President Vladimir Putin.They both want to begin work on a bilateral trade agreement, which for May would provide proof of stability amid the Brexit breakup and for Trump would support his belief that he can negotiate one-on-one trade pacts.&quot;They both need this to be a success,&quot; said Heather Conley, a European expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank.

In her speech, May said Western leaders should &quot;engage but beware&quot; of Putin and should not accept Putin&#39;s claim that Eastern Europe is now in his sphere of influence. Trump, on the other hand, wants a strong U.S. relationship with Russia to fight Islamic State militants.&quot;I don&#39;t know Putin, but if we can get along with Russia, that&#39;s a great thing,&quot; Trump told Fox News&#39; Sean Hannity&quot; on Thursday. &quot;It&#39;s good for Russia, it&#39;s good for us.&quot; ALSO READ: Peter Kenneth set to get Jubilee ticket as rivals lured with new posts to quit
