The presidency has denied any role in the withdrawal of the bodyguards of Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi.The withdrawals come after Mr Joho&#39;s spat with President Uhuru Kenyatta and the Jubilee administration over projects in Coast region. State House spokesman Manoah Esipisu yesterday said there was no political motive behind the withdrawals, adding that the regional police commander who issued the order was just re-orginasing security in the area.&quot;There is no political motive in the withdrawal of VIP security. It is up to the regional commander to make decisions he deems fit,&quot; Mr Esipisu explained.On Friday, the Government withdrew the bodyguards of Joho and Mr Kingi without explanation, drawing protests from Opposition politicians.

This will open up great opportunities between Tanzania, Taveta and Voi,&quot; he said.In Tana River County, he said the Government had spent Sh477 million on spot improvement and routine maintenance of the Charedende&ndash;Bura, Makutano-Hola and Hola Township roads.He said the Government was also upgrading roads in Kwale County at a cost of more than Sh5 billion. These include the Diani-Lunga Lunga, Bachuma-Maji Ya Chumvi, Milala-Mivumoni-Kilulu, Kwale-Mwaluganje, Kwale-Golini and Kwale-Kinango-Samburu roads.On water projects, he said the Baricho works expansion project was about to begin at a cost of Sh2.7 billion and would serve over 150,000 Malindi people.
