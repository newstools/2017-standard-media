Questions linger as selection panel defends IEBC nominess denied claims that it was contemplating having a special meeting to rethink their choice of IEBC chairman and some commissioners.On Tuesday, the panel went to great lengths to defend itself against claims that it had been rocked by infighting following the choices they made after interviewing applicants.

The panel, chaired by Bernadette Musundi, instead told those with complaints to take them to the Parliamentary Committee on Justice and Legal Affairs for consideration.&quot;The attention of the selection panel has been drawn to reports appearing in various media concerning some of the persons selected by the IEBC Selection Panel for nomination to the positions of chairperson and member of the commission,&quot; Ms Musundi said.&quot;In particular, there have been various allegations in the media concerning the suitability or otherwise of Mr Wafula Chebukati and Ms Consolata Nkatha Maina for appointment to the positions of chairperson and member of IEBC, respectively.&quot; ALSO READ: Banker quits NIC for politicsShe added: &quot;At the outset, the panel wishes to state that these allegations were not brought to the attention of the IEBC Selection Panel by any person and were therefore not in the knowledge of the panel during the selection process.&quot;Other criteriaOn December 23, the selection panel settled on Chebukati, alongside High Court advocate Tukero ole Kina for IEBC chairman.

I want to be told why every time the electoral board is constituted, people from our region are left out and others from certain communities take up the commissioners&#39; jobs. It is not possible that our own community cannot give a commissioner for IEBC,&quot; Mr Gumbo lamented.Both IEBC chairman nominee Chebukati and chief executive Ezra Chiloba come from the same county.But Musundi yesterday brushed off the concerns.
