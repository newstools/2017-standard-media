It is especially hard for the relatives of those who are missing. You have no idea if you are a widow or not,&quot; Ms Gitau said.She refers to the situation as complicated grief because the families are unable to resume their old lives fully.&quot;It is a new experience for all of us. Kenya has never gone to war before and what we need most of all is goodwill from the Government and the corporate world to support these families,&quot; she said.Using the network of families in the organisation, they have managed to reach families in Nanyuki, Bungoma, Thika and Kirinyaga.Ms Kukubo said the centre would give pre-deployment training for families whose relatives were going to the battlefront.
