I will, however, implement the project after agreement with my wife and family members,&quot; said Kungu.Kung&#39;u attended Rurii Primary School before joining Rurii Secondary School where he sat his Kenya Certificate of Secondary Education examination in 1996 and scored a C+.After completing his secondary education, he enrolled at Kenya Medical Training College in Embu where he studied for a diploma in environmental health.However, life after college was not easy for the subsistence farmer who travelled to Nairobi to seek employment.He was employed as a matatu driver but later dropped because the job was too demanding with little pay.Kung&#39;u later travelled back to his ancestral village and ventured into small-scale farming including rearing chickens, dairy and crop production.Life in the village, he said, has not been easy. At times, he is forced to borrow money from his friends and family members.Peter Oyier, a Communication Officer with Lotto said Kung&#39;u is the first beneficiary of the Sh100 million super power draw in East and Central Africa.Oyier said the farmer received the highest amount since the betting firm set up shop in Kenya.
