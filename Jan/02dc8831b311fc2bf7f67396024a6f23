While plenty of cannabis goes up in smoke in coffee shops around the Netherlands, Dutch researchers have found a new use for it - as an environmentally friendly building material to rival cement or steel.They have used hemp - a variety of cannabis which has many industrial applications including in textiles and insulation - and flax - the plant that linen is made of - to make an experimental footbridge to test the materials&#39; load-bearing properties. &quot;Actually it&#39;s the first &#39;bio-based&#39; bridge in the world, as far as we know,&quot; said Rijk Blok, an assistant professor of structural design at the Eindhoven University of Technology.The hemp and flax fibers are combined in a resin that is stuck to a core made of polylactic acid, a polymer also made of plant material, to form the span of the 14-metre (46-foot) bridge over a stream on the university campus.The developers - at several Dutch colleges and companies - are using sensors to monitor the bridge&#39;s performance as people walk and run over it for a year.They first had to demonstrate that the bridge could withstand a load of 500 kilograms per square meter in laboratory stress tests before building permission was granted.&quot;This was our research - trying to find out: Can they be used in a structural load-bearing capacity? And this bridge is the proof,&quot; Blok said.
