Kanu will in two weeks-time reveal who, between Jubilee and the Opposition, it will support in the August 8 presidential election.The party&rsquo;s National Executive Council (NEC) Thursday mandated its Chairman, Baringo Senator Gideon Moi to negotiate with leaders from the two coalitions and report to it on the best option for the former ruling party.Addressing the media after the NEC meeting at the party&rsquo;s headquarters, Gideon said he had been directed by the party organ to engage with both Jubilee and National Super Alliance (NASA), that includes CORD, and give direction on the presidential candidate to support in the elections. &ldquo;I have been mandated to talk to everybody and keep all the options open. As at now we do not have a preferred candidate, but in about two weeks, we will meet again for me to give a report on who to support,&rdquo; said Gideon.However, Gideon revealed that the party&rsquo;s NEC had agreed on fielding candidates for all other elective positions, but consider the best presidential candidate, who the party will ask its members to support.&ldquo;In making this choice, we will of course be guided, importantly by who between the Jubilee and the Opposition presidential candidates has the best interest for us and the country,&rdquo; said Gideon.

What is concrete is that Kanu will not dissolve as a party. We will field all other candidates,&rdquo; he said.The Party&rsquo;s Secretary General Nick Salat said his association with the Opposition had been discussed at the robust meeting, where he presented the report on the overtures from NASA, but the NEC members agreed to wait for the report from Gideon&rsquo;s engagements before they could make a decision.&ldquo;We left nothing to chance. I gave my report on my going to NASA and the report was well received. If there is anyone with another report from any other quarter, he is free to also table it,&rdquo; said Salat.Salat shared a forum with Senators Zipporah Kitonny and Prof John Lonyangapuo, two of the party officials who openly dismissed sentiments by the Secretary General that KANU was part of NASA, during a recent meeting by the Opposition chiefs.The two senators claimed that Salat&rsquo;s comments were personal and not the official position of KANU.Thursday, Salat said that once Gideon reports to NEC on the presidential candidate that the party would support, they would summon a National Delegates Conference (NDC) for its endorsement.
