Kenya is keen to build on the success of last year as a major conference tourism destination.Among the high-profile international events to be staged in the country this year include the Aid and Development Africa Summit in Nairobi.The summit will bring together representatives from finance ministries from different aid-dependent African countries, who will hold talks with western donor countries on the future of aid and trade on the continent.

Of the participants at the meetings, 55 per cent were locals.Pan-African participants consisted 22 per cent, regional East African participants (15 per cent) and international attendees (eight per cent).The busiest meeting period in 2016 was recorded as between September and November.
