Nairobi-based painter and sculptor Michael Soi is one of the leading artists in Kenya today. His paintings largely borrow on the cartoon form to provide satirical commentary on events shaping society.One of his popular series of paintings is called China Loves Africa. It involves a colourful array of risqu&eacute; paintings that summarise the largely negative global perception of the Asian nation&rsquo;s 16-year dalliance with the continent. But now, a new study by leading economist David Dollar is challenging this view of China&rsquo;s involvement with Africa. It addresses key myths that have overshadowed international trade and foreign policy between the two regions for close to two decades.In the paper China&rsquo;s Engagement with Africa; From Natural Resources to Human Resources, Dr Dollar argues that China&rsquo;s engagement with Africa is a win-win relationship for both regions.However, he admits that the scale of the Asian Tiger&rsquo;s investment in Africa has traditionally been exaggerated.

This would represent less than 5 per cent of the total stock of foreign investment on the continent.&rdquo;Dollar adds that even if one doubles this figure to account for China&rsquo;s indirect investment through avenues like the Hong Kong financial markets or loans through the state-owned Export-Import Bank of China, the country&rsquo;s share of overall investment remains modest.&ldquo;Chinese financing is substantial enough to contribute meaningfully to African investment and growth, but the notion that China has provided an overwhelming amount of finance and is buying up the whole continent is inaccurate,&rdquo; he says.Dollar is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and served as the US Treasury&rsquo;s economic and financial emissary to China from 2009 to 2013.He leans on his role in facilitating policy dialogue between the two polar economies and 20-year World Bank experience in presenting his 125-page study.

This is complicated by the influx of Chinese workers who initially move for work but stay on.The number of Chinese workers in Africa is said to be disproportionately high when compared to the amount of financing China has provided, and compared to migrants from other countries.So while Chinese workers bring skills and entrepreneurship, their large numbers limit African workers&rsquo; opportunities for jobs.&ldquo;One of the major failings of the SGR project is the near exclusion of local suppliers,&rdquo; said Sanghi and Johnson.&ldquo;Local manufacturers were only able to supply cement and a negligible amount of steel to SGR; contractors imported the rest of the materials from China. Local manufacturers missed a valuable opportunity for capacity building, knowledge sharing and long-term job creation.&rdquo;Ultimately, whether Kenya gains or loses in its bilateral relationship with China depends on what Kenya does with its fledgling manufacturing sector.

The country no longer has the demand for minerals like copper and iron that built its manufacturing epoch.This has already caused a slump in demand for African commodities, dragging the continent&rsquo;s average GDP growth to a 20-year low, with the economies of resource-dependent countries like Angola, Nigeria and South Africa hit hard.Dollar argues that the effects are likely to be permanent as China enters the next chapter of growth that will see it demand less energy and commodities. This shift is likely to &ldquo;have long-term effects on commodity prices and commodity trade volumes&rdquo;.Thus, as Kenya prepares the first batch of oil exports that will put the country in the league of oil-producing nations later this year, economists say the key to inclusive economic growth lies in building the country&rsquo;s manufacturing and tradeable services exports.China&rsquo;s working-age has peaked, and improved living standards and wages means more Chinese firms will be outsourcing manufacturing and services to lower-wage areas.With more than 50 per cent of Africans under the age of 20, Africa&rsquo;s demographic dividend is said to be equal to China&rsquo;s at the turn of the century, and could make the continent an outpost of manufacturing and tradeable services.fsunday@standardmedia.co.ke
