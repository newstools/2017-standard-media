The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) yesterday said it had corrected the anomaly of a double voter registration using CORD leader Raila Odinga&#39;s national identity card number.IEBC officials said they had traced the woman who registered as a voter using Raila&#39;s ID number. The anomaly could have seen the CORD leader barred from voting in the August elections - in which he is expected to vie for the presidency.Raila last week protested that he shared an ID card number with a woman he didn&#39;t know, making him a victim of double registration. Similar reports were reported across registration centres in Nyanza region. IEBC traced the woman to Alego Usonga to change her particulars in order to allow both her and the CORD leader to cast their votes in August.According to Central Nyanza IEBC co-ordinator George Oyugi, the commission worked hard to find the woman, who had been traced by noon yesterday.MISPLACED NUMBER ALSO READ: Why Kalonzo wants Raila to quit big race&quot;We have sorted the matter out&nbsp;and Raila is now free to go and vote.
