USA: One of about a dozen women who previously accused President-elect Donald Trump of making unwanted sexual advances filed a lawsuit against him in New York on Tuesday, alleging he had made false and defamatory statements about her in rejecting the accusation, causing her emotional and economic harm.The lawsuit filed by Summer Zervos, a one-time contestant on Trump&#39;s reality television show &quot;The Apprentice,&quot; is focused on a stream of denials Trump aimed at her and other women accusers last October, just weeks before the Nov. 8 presidential election, when Zervos and others came forward to accuse the then-candidate of making unwanted sexual advances. Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks called the allegations &quot;absurd.&quot;&ldquo;More of the same from Gloria Allred,&quot; said Hicks, referring to Zervos&#39; high-profile attorney. &quot;There is no truth to this absurd story.&quot;At the time the women made their allegations, Trump, a Republican, who went on to win the election and who takes office on Friday, adamantly denied all the accusations in posts on Twitter, statements, interviews and comments at rallies. He suggested at one rally in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Oct. 14 that the accusers were fabricating their stories for publicity or to damage his campaign.
