Universities must brace for tough times ahead after the Government cut funding by Sh5 billion.This is contained in the 2016-2017 Supplementary Funding estimates that will push universities deeper into financial crisis, especially because they have been operating on a Sh9 billion deficit. The reduced funding also casts a spotlight on the survival of some universities, especially those that will now have to depend on students&#39; fees.The cut reduces the initially approved estimates from Sh72 billion to Sh66.8 billion.Some of the programmes affected by the reduced funding are research, science, technology and innovation, whose funding has been reduced by between Sh1 billion and Sh3 billion.
