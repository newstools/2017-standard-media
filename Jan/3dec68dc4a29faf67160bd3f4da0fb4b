A deal may be reached between doctors and the Government as another meeting is scheduled for Thursday, January 19.According to sources privy to the discussions, the two parties are set to delve into the contentious Article Four of the Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that contains the new salaries.Wednesday, the parties centred the discussions on Article Three of the CBA, which entails the doctors&#39; rights. And in the four-hour discussions - from 10am to 2pm - the parties are said to have cemented the common ground on the discussions.After the meeting, Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu was said to have gone to update President Uhuru Kenyatta on the progress.However, there were no qualms on the Article as some of the demands stipulated by the doctors had already been handled in their latest deal that offered them 40 per cent.
