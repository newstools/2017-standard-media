Manila: Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte has said he would impose martial law if the drug problem became &quot;very virulent&quot;, just a month after dismissing as &quot;nonsense&quot; any suggestion he might do so.&nbsp;Duterte has made a brutal war on drugs a central pillar of his administration since he took office in the middle of last year.Since July, more than 6,000 people have been killed in the anti-drug campaign, in both police operations and unexplained killings by suspected &quot;vigilantes&quot;. More than 1 million drug peddlers and users have been arrested or have surrendered to authorities.Duterte, speaking to members of a chamber of commerce in the southern city of Davao late on Saturday, said he has sworn to protect the country against all threats, including drugs, which he said has affected about 4 million people.&quot;If I wanted to, and it will deteriorate into something really very virulent, I will declare martial law,&quot; he said.

We had martial law before, what happened? Did it improve our lives now? Not at all,&quot; he said.
