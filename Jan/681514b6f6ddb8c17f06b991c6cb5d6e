He had been described as &quot;a pillar of the Islamic revolution&quot;. His pragmatic policies &ndash; economic liberalisation, better relations with the West and empowering elected bodies - appealed to many Iranians but were despised by hardliners.Few have wielded such influence in modern Iran but since 2009 Rafsanjani and his family faced political isolation over their support for the opposition movement which lost a disputed election that year to President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.Rafsanjani headed the Expediency Council, a body which is intended to resolve disputes between the parliament and the Guardian Council.

His absence from that debate, whenever it happens, means the chances of a pragmatist emerging as the next supreme leader are reduced.His death ahead of May&#39;s presidential elections is a blow to moderate president Hassan Rouhani who allied himself with Rafsanjani to win the 2013 election and went on to resolve Iran&#39;s long standoff with the West on the nuclear programme.&quot;The soul of the great man of the Revolution, symbol of patience and resistance has gone to Heaven,&quot; Rouhani tweeted.Abbas Milani, director of the Iranian Studies program at Stanford University, said his death could not have come at a worse time, as President-elect Donald Trump prepares to take office.&quot;With what is happening in the U.S. and the possible instability that is going to come in U.S. policy you needed a voice of reason and pragmatism that had some heft to it. He was that voice.&quot;&quot;Losing that voice is going to make it more likely that any mishap or miscalculation by the Trump team will beget a more unreasonable, more radical, more potentially destructive response by the Iranian regime,&quot; he added.Trump had said during his campaign for the White House that he would scrap Iran&#39;s pact with world powers - under which Tehran agreed to curb its nuclear program in return for lifted sanctions - describing it as &quot;the worst deal ever negotiated&quot;.
