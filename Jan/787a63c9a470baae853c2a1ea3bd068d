Jubilee leaders in Mombasa have warned Governor Ali Hassan Joho to stop his incessant attacks on President Uhuru Kenyatta.Speaking at a press conference at the county Jubilee offices in Nyali yesterday, the party leaders led by Suleiman Shahbal said Joho&#39;s attacks on Uhuru had degenerated into personal insults. They claimed the county chief&#39;s views on Uhuru and Jubilee were personal and did not represent those of Mombasa residents.&quot;He does not in any way speak on behalf of the Mombasa populace. We are known to be very hospitable and disciplined people and the likes of Joho do not fall within our midst,&quot; said Shahbal who lost the 2013 gubernatorial race to Joho. The leaders questioned the priorities of the Joho-led county government and warned him to stop his incessant attacks on the Jubilee administration.

The Jubilee government has seen the suffering and is now eager to help,&quot; he said.Interim Jubilee Party Mombasa Chairman Matano Chengo challenged Governor Joho to state which projects he had initiated since he was elected into office.&quot;The mere painting of the Coast Provincial General Hospital yet the institution continues to lack adequate drugs is a mockery to Mombasa and the coastal citizens who rely on its services,&quot; Chengo said.
