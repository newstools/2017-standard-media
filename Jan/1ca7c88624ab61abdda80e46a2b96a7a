Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) loaned banks billions of shillings to remain afloat between June 2015 and 2016.CBK lent over Sh44.6 billion to banks as it moved to restore confidence in the market during a banking crisis that saw Dubai Bank, Imperial Bank and Chase Bank shut down. Chase bank was later reopened.The measure saw CBK give small lenders 600 times more loans than in 2015 to stem heavy withdrawals witnessed during the crisis period that was followed by the collapse of three mid-tier banks. Latest data shows the regulator stepped in to save banks facing liquidity issues after their peers denied them money through inter-bank lending fearing exposure.This saw CBK make a killing, pocketing a net interest income of Sh11.9 billion, up from Sh4.2 billion in 2015.CBK, the lender of last resort, loaned the banks the billions through reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) and the discounting window.

However, the reduction has been gradual. ALSO READ: Tough going for small banks as CBK steps up liquidity mop-up
