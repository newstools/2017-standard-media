Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula and his deputy Boni Khalwale now claim that Amani National Congress leader Musalia Mudavadi is a Jubilee project.The two claimed Mr Mudavadi was being used by the Government to weaken the Opposition. They also alleged that the recent endorsement of Mudavadi as the Luhya spokesman would not add votes to the Opposition but only bring confusion.The senators claimed Mudavadi was working for the good of the Jubilee team due to his association with Central Organisation of Trade Unions Secretary General Francis Atwoli.&quot;If Mudavadi is seriously interested in teaming up with CORD, he should focus on the agenda and forget about associating himself with Atwoli, who is engaged in political business,&quot; said Mr Wetang&#39;ula.
