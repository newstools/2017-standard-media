Fusionconsultant.co.ke staff at Faith Ventures Academy parents day exhibition demonstrating to parents,Supotco,the award winning parental control app that is able to remotely control the games and websites a child can access on their phone or tablet. The arrival of mobile phones in the society is a blessing and a curse to many parents.Busy parents find it easier to get in contact with their kids at a click of a button thereby improving relationship even when work doesn&rsquo;t allow for one&rsquo;s physical presence to the family.However mobile phones have also provided a leeway for criminals and malicious people to target children for exploitation and other activities such as kidnapping.&ldquo;Mobile phones are now part of life and in most families parents are now introducing the gadgets to their kids at early stages for easier communication, but parents also consider internet enabled phones as a plus to kids especially in helping them do research for school work,&rdquo; notes Paul Ndungu, operations in charge at Fusion Consultants.Ndungu who is also a counsellor says phone use among kids may work to the disadvantage of parents if not closely monitored.&ldquo;We need safeguards to prevent child exploitation, to help parents monitor strangers who may harm our kids and to control use of applications that may distract kids,&rdquo; he says.Fusion Consultant, a leading IT company in Nairobi recently introduced Supotco software in the Kenyan market which allows parents to remotely monitor their child&#39;s phone usage and manage what they download, what games they play and for how long.The software also allows parents to screen calls and contacts, check what websites kids visit and provides GPS information about the whereabouts of children.&quot;Supotco allows parents to provide a simple way for their children to avoid unnecessary contacts, harassment and cyber bullying when using a mobile phone,&rdquo; he says in an interview.&quot;If the parent does not add a feature, app or contact then the child cannot access that feature and neither can that feature access the child.&quot;In its current form children must have an Android phone to operate Supotco, with the parents using an online dashboard to customise it, which can be accessed from any smartphone, tablet, PC or laptop.The software is available for free 14-days trial at www.supot.co thereafter a charge of 3.6 pounds applies per month.Fusion Consultant operations Manager Juliet Mwangi (3rd from Left) receives award for the best Parental Control App of the year (www.supot.co), from Dr. Waudo Siganga, Chairman Computer Society of Kenya during the CSK 2016 Excellence Awards ceremony at Laico Regency
