Mr Duale has since disowned the recording, claiming the video clip was fake and a creation of his political opponents.&quot;For such a case to progress we must have a witness. We are appealing to anyone who was present when hate speech said to have been made in Garissa to report to DCI headquarters and provide information that would help in the investigations,&quot; said Mr Boinnet.He had earlier on said police would use voice experts to analyse the audio clip directing youths in Garissa not to allow members of Kamba community register as voters in the region.

Investigations are being handled by competent officers,&quot; he said.Boinnet did not mention Duale throughout the interview.Both the Directorate of Criminal Investigations and National Cohesion and Integration Commission (NCIC) are investigating the matter.Opinion has been split on the authenticity of the clip, with some quarters arguing it could be an imitation. Experts say that even though people speak differently when happy, angry, drunk or under duress, there is a unique pattern of speaking that can identify one&#39;s voice.&quot;We will use experts to give their report on the voice before the file is sent to the DPP for action. The DPP will also make his decision,&quot; said an official aware of the probe.Police have already taken voice recordings from Duale.

I will pay your bills and all costs,&quot; says the voice in the clip.
