Reducing the consent age for sex age from 18 to 16 will increase rape or sexual assault cases in Kenya, Nyanza Initiative for Girls&rsquo; Education &amp; Empowerment (NIGEE) founder Dr Kawango Agot has warned. She said the gains made in fighting HIV/Aids and teenage pregnancies are about to be washed down the drain if the legislators reduce the age of consent.Leading a peaceful demonstration to condemn the proposed amendment to the Sexual Offences Act, Agot said Kenya has selfish leaders. She said the matter was being handled reluctantly by politicians, yet they were putting a lot of energy in debating how they will retain power. &ldquo;The sexual Offense Act is more important than politics. It is about our future. But the people we elected are not concerned about what affects Kenyans,&rdquo; she said.&nbsp;
