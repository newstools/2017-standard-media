Nyamira County Governor John Nyagarama has done a reshuffle in his cabinet, the eighth since he took office in 2013.County officers were taken to a rude shock after returning from Christmas and New Year festivities after learning that the reshuffle was announced through a Kenya Gazette notice which was published on December 29, 2016. Pursuant to the powers conferred by the Constitution of Kenya and the County Governments Act, the Governor of Nyamira County has re-organized the county government departments and entities as contained in Nyamira County Circular number 2 of 2016,&quot; read part of the Gazette notice.Nyagarama silently did the reshuffle, something which has been viewed as a move to counter the County Assembly which for the last three weeks has been committed towards addressing issues to do with the county&#39;s budget.In the reshuffle which has been widely criticized, Nyagarama affected the Finance, Roads, Transport and Public works, Education, planning and Trade dockets which were heavily with executive members in the departments being swapped.

Dr Komemenda who is already set to seek the Nyamira Women Representative seat was moved to the department of Lands, Housing and Planning which was initially held by Mr Richard Mareri who will now be heading the Trade docket.Chief Officers from the five departments were also reshuffled with Mr Edward Ondigi who was the accounting officer at the Agriculture department replacing Jackline Kemunto at the Finance department.Kemunto was taken to the department of Trade in the same capacity.Also moved were Mr Thomas Geni who will be serving at the department of Lands.Health, Agriculture, Public Administration, Gender and Environment Executives were spared the reorganisation.

Any right thinking person can ask if there can be any meaningful achievement the changes are going to bring about if it is not a tact to confuse the Assembly&#39;s resolve to hold his (Nyagarama) accountable,&quot; said Nyamoko.&nbsp;
