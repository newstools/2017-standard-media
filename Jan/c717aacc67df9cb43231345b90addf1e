President Uhuru Kenyatta has assented to the Elections Laws (Amendment) Bill, 2016.This means the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) can now put in place a complementary mechanism for identification of voters and transmission of elections results, the Presidential Strategic Communications Unit said in a statement. That complementary mechanism, says the new law, must be &quot;simple, accurate, verifiable, secure, accountable and transparent to ensure the commission complies with the provisions of Article 38 of the Constitution&quot;.President Kenyatta signed the bill at State House, Nairobi upon his arrival from attending former nominated MP Mark Too&#39;s funeral in Eldoret.The new law, passed by the Senate on Thursday night, was signed amid disquiet in the Opposition.
