Nairobi, Kenya: Doctors&rsquo; officials have presented themselves in court for sentencing after they were found guilty of contempt.On Tuesday, judge Helen Wasilwa issued a warrant of arrest against seven officials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) for refusing to appear in court for sentencing after being found guilty of disobeying a court order to end the ongoing strike.The union officials&rsquo; phones were switched off for the better part of Wednesday presumably for fear of being incarcerated. Calls to the union&rsquo;s chairperson Samuel Oroko, Secretary General Frederick Oluga and Nairobi branch Secretary Thuranira Kuagiria could not go through. Other officials that were being sought by the police are Titus Ondoro, Allan Ochanji, Hamisi Chibanzi, Daisy Korir and Evelyne Chege.In the recent past, the striking medics have taken to the streets to address their grievances, being active on social media and getting holed up in discreet venues for meetings.Related videos ALSO READ: Doctors' union officials go into hiding to avoid arrest&nbsp;&nbsp;
