Lady luck came smiling for a 14-year-old boy from a poor background who sat his Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) last year after well wishers offered to pay his school fees.Dennis Ngatia Wangu sat KCPE at Kimahuri Primary School in Kieni East, Nyeri County and scored 403 marks, but his hopes of joining Kagumo High School were nearly dashed due to lack of fees. Ngatia is the first born son of Jane Wangu, a single mother of three, among them twins aged four months. The teenager was prepared to repeat Standard Eight to give his mother time to accumulate money to take him to secondary school.But following an expose in a section of the media, well wishers, among them Kieni MP Kanini Kega and businesswoman and patron of Maendeleo Mashinani Lobby group, Rahab Mukami came to his aid and pledged to sponsor his secondary school education.Others who pledged to help include a well wisher from Capital FM radio who paid a year&rsquo;s school fees, as well as the Nyeri County Government through Education Executive Secretary Erastus Muriuki, who pledged Sh10,000 annual bursary for four years. Ms Mukami, who visited the boy at his former school after she was alerted of his plight by the school&rsquo;s headteacher urged leaders to assist bright and needy students, noting that more pupils are in dire need.
