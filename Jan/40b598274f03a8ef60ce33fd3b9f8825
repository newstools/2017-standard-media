BUNGOMA, KENYA: Bungoma Governor Ken Lusaka has said his support for Jubilee Party is solid and unquestionable.The statement comes days after social media claims that the experienced administrator and one of Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s key point-men in Western was ditching Jubilee for the opposition. &quot;It is a fact; I am in Jubilee to stay. This is a union of political parties that has transformed Western Kenya&#39;s fortunes,&quot; said Mr Lusaka, who has been proposed to be the party&#39;s national chairman.The Bungoma Governor said it was unfortunate that social media was being used to push for lies and propaganda. &quot;This adds no value to the welfare of our society. May we use this communication platform to make our society better.&quot;He said the party will be rolling out major campaigns in the entire country, a &quot;tsunami that could sweep away the opposition&quot;.
