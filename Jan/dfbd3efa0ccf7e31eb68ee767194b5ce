African heritage experts gathered in Mombasa have warned that many of the continent&#39;s valuable heritage sites are under threat from uncontrolled development, coastal erosion and civil unrest. The experts under the auspices of Centre for Heritage Development (CHD) meeting at the Lotus Hotel in Mombasa said African governments need to pull resources in helping mitigate the threats. The heritage experts added that despite their value, many of the sites in the continent are being affected by mineral extraction, construction of large scale roads and ports. Mr Peter Dennis Okwaro, a Director with CHD called on African governments to expend more resources in the protection and preservation of the world heritage sites. &#39;&#39;We are gathered here in Mombasa as heritage professionals representing Anglophone Africa to deliberate on the best ways to mitigate the threats faced by the heritage sites,&#39;&#39; he said in Mombasa on Monday. He said the need for mega infrastructural and industrial development in the continent if not well planned pose a serious threat to the protection and conservation of heritage in the continent. Okwaro said the African continent is very rich in natural and cultural heritage but expressed concern that only 127 properties have been inscribed on the prestigious UNESCO World Heritage List, out of a total of 1031 sites worldwide. &#39;&#39;But not only is Africa under-represented on the word heritage list, it also has the highest number of world heritage properties on the list of world heritage in danger,&#39;&#39; he said. The world heritage list has 911 sites globally, listed for their unique natural and cultural value. Of these 34 are on the list of world heritage in danger.
