A Kakamega court heard that a complainant was gang-raped by machete-wielding suspects who threatened to kill her. The complainant said the two accused &ndash; Evans Namunyu and Nickson Muhatia &ndash; broke into her house in September, last year, and raped her in turns as her children watched. The accused put the complainant in an awkward position with pesky questions. Namunyu challenged the complainant to mimic his voice to prove to the court she was telling the truth about him being one of her attackers while Muhatia questioned how she could have been raped by two people at the same time. The court, however, saved her from answering the questions. The complainant told the court she texted her husband after the 30-minute ordeal and accompanied her mother-in-law to hospital and later reported the incident to the police.

The complainant&#39;s mother-in-law also testified how she took her to hospital and reported the matter to the police. A doctor who treated the woman will testify on March 6.
