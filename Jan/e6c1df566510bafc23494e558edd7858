Police reinstate bodyguards for Mombasa Governor Hassan Joho and his Kilifi counterpart Amason Kingi after reorganisation.The State had withdrawn armed police security from governors Amason Kingi of Kilifi and Hassan Joho of Mombasa less than 36 hours of their withering attack on President Uhuru Kenyatta who was visiting the Coast. This happened even as it emerged that the government had also issued a stern warning to police officers escorting governors in chase cars and clearing roads for them at the expense of other road users.Sometime at the beginning of 2016, an altercation erupted between Governor Hassan Joho and President Uhuru Kenyatta.Mr Joho was miffed by the fact that the President and his entourage had neither invited him nor informed him of the President&#39;s long stay in Mombasa, not even &quot;as a matter of protocol&quot;.

The President was in Mombasa again, but this time the State appears to have launched an offensive against the governor early. While Joho was away, his security and that of his key ally, Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi was withdrawn.Joho and Mr Kingi have easily distinguished themselves as Uhuru&#39;s and Jubilee&#39;s most ardent critics, among governors, and the only ones with the guts to talk back at the Head of State in his presence, earning the adulation of some and hatred of others.
