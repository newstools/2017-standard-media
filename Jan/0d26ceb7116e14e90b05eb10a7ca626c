Alex Akugo emerged the ODM nominee who will be vying in the by-election for Central Kanyamkago ward on the 22nd of March 2017 after he beat four other contestants to clinch the ODM certificate as the party held nominations on Saturday.The seat fell vacant following the demise of area MCA Michael Osongo who died on September 26 last year following a long struggle with throat cancer. Akugo won by 1,994 votes narrowly beating his biggest competitor Ken Nyamita who got 1,935 in a battle that was touted as a gauge of Uriri Supremacy between Governor Obado and Mark Nyamita the gubernatorial aspirant who both come from Uriri Sub-County.This is because Akugo the nominee is the brother to Dominic Akugo, the Director of Administration and Governance in the Office of the Governor while Ken Nyamita is the younger brother to Mark Nyamita as both Dominic and Mark were earnestly campaigning for their kin.The competition also brought about the underlying rivalry between the natives of Kanyamkago and the &ldquo;jodak,&rdquo; that is the non- natives of Kanyamkago.
