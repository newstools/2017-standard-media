Reince Priebus said Trump believed Russia was behind the intrusions into the Democratic Party organizations, although Priebus did not clarify whether the president-elect agreed that the hacks were directed by Russian President Vladimir Putin.&quot;He accepts the fact that this particular case was entities in Russia, so that&#39;s not the issue,&quot; Priebus said on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot;It was the first acknowledgment from a senior member of the Republican president-elect&#39;s team that Trump had accepted that Russia directed the hacking and subsequent disclosure of Democratic emails during the 2016 presidential election.

A crucial test of Republican support for Trump comes this week with the first confirmation hearings for his Cabinet picks.A U.S. intelligence report last week said Putin directed a sophisticated influence campaign including cyber attacks to denigrate Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and support Trump.The report, commissioned by Democratic President Barack Obama in December, concluded vote tallies were not affected by Russian interference, but did not assess whether it influenced the outcome of the vote in other ways.&nbsp;&#39;ACTION MAY BE TAKEN&#39;After receiving a briefing on Friday from leaders of the U.S. intelligence agencies, Trump did not refer specifically to Russia&#39;s role in the presidential campaign.

He added on CBS, however, that the Russians remained a &quot;big adversary, and they demonstrated it by trying to mess around in our election.&quot;Obama, who himself tried to &quot;reset&quot; relations with Russia after he took office in 2009, told NBC he did not think he had underestimated the Russian president.&quot;But I think that I underestimated the degree to which, in this new information age, it is possible for misinformation for cyber hacking and so forth to have an impact on our open societies, our open systems, to insinuate themselves into our democratic practices in ways that I think are accelerating,&quot; he said in an interview with &quot;Meet the Press&quot; broadcast on Sunday.
