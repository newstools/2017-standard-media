The city county government has resolved to sack striking doctors by Friday if they do not go back to work.Approximately 124 doctors joined the nationwide strike that began in December despite talks with the county government. The strike is now in its sixth week. Speaking in Mathare, Nairobi Governor Evans Kidero said the county had written to doctors to provide show-cause letters on why they should not be dismissed.&quot;The doctors continued striking despite the court declaring it illegal. Anyone that does not resume work should know that they stand sacked,&quot; said Dr Kidero.The city boss said the county had already taken disciplinary action against doctors by not paying them their December salaries. He confirmed that only 54 doctors had resumed work across all county hospitals since December.
