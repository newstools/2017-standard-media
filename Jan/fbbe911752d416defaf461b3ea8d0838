President Uhuru Kenyatta on Friday read the riot act to two local MPs for allegedly urging Kiambu residents not to vote on August 8 if a road in Limuru was not repaired.Kabete MP Ferdinand Waititu and his Thika Town counterpart Alice Ng&#39;ang&#39;a were last weekend captured on record telling an angry crowd in Limuru constituency not to turn up for voting in the August 8 polls should the Government fail to fix the road.In a video clip from the rally, Mr Waititu is seen urging residents to register as voters but not turn out on August 8 if the Wangige-Ngecha-Rironi road, which cuts across Kabete and Limuru constituencies, is not repaired. &quot;Everyone who has been elected must first repair this road if they want to be re-elected. When Uhuru comes here, he too should be told to repair this road before the elections are held,&quot; he said. &quot;This time, we are not pacifying anyone. There won&#39;t be mollifying a donkey on a slope.&quot;And Ms Ng&#39;ang&#39;a was captured saying: &quot;When the President comes, the first issue he should address before seeking votes or telling us to collect IDs and voters&#39; cards is this road.&quot;Speaking in Ruiru when he toured parts of the county to mobile locals to register as voters, President Kenyatta hit out at the two lawmakers for their remarks.
