Computer experts say it is possible to conduct the 2017 General Election without a manual back-up system.A cross-section of experts disputed claims by ICT Cabinet Secretary Joe Mucheru that a manual system is necessary in case the electronic voting system fail. In a memorandum sent to the Senate under the lobby Kenya ICT Action Network (KITCAnet), the experts drawn from both the private sector and academia have asked Parliament to revise the amendment to sections 39 and 44 of the Elections Law (Amendment) Bill, 2016.&ldquo;The employment of technology in elections management is meant to address questions of integrity of the election and efficiency in transmission of the results,&rdquo; explains KITCAnet in part.KICTAnet further states that once the IEBC system has been procured, it is possible for the technical committee to agree on the best way of mitigating potential system vulnerabilities.
