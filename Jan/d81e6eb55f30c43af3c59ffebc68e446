Vihiga Governor Moses Akaranga wants the office of the registrar of persons decentralised from counties to sub-counties.Akaranga said people living far from county headquarters face challenges getting birth certificates and national identity cards. &quot;There are challenges especially when the person has to come to the county headquarters on several occasions just looking for a birth certificate and yet they can easily access the document at the sub-county in this era of devolution,&quot; Akaranga said.He said whereas the legislators from the region want thousands of their constituents registered during the mass voter registration commencing today, many still lack identity cards.&quot;We want our people to be registered in huge numbers, and that will only be implemented if the services are brought closer to them in the villages,&quot; he said.
