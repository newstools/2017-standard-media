President Uhuru Kenyatta has described Mombasa as a narcotics hub and vowed to deal with all drug barons.The President spoke in Mombasa amid reports that sons of the Akasha family in Mombasa and two foreigners from India and Pakistan who have been linked to drug trade had been extradited to the US to face charges in New York.&quot;Their days are over. We are not dealing with peddlers we will deal with the big fish. We will deal with the drug barons decisively,&quot; the Head of State said during his tour of Mombasa on Tuesday. In August 2014, Uhuru witnessed the destruction of MV Al Noor, a ship that was seized with 377kg of heroin worth Sh1.3 billion in what was seen as a clear sign of Jubilee&#39;s determination to deal with narcotics.In June 2015, State officials led by Internal Security Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery destroyed a luxury yacht that was also seized ferrying heroine worth Sh22 million.The destruction of the two vessels is however subject of litigation in Mombasa and Nairobi, with both the accused lawyers challenging the destruction&#39;s legality.
