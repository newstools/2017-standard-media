Eldoret-based lawyer Simon Lilan who went missing on Jan 9 resurfaced on Friday evening at the Law Society of Kenya offices in Nairobi said he had been hiding in a city apartment.Two weeks ago, Lilan went to court and sought to halt the burial of prominent politician Mark Too until the police unearth the cause of his death after the former Nominated MP collapsed in his bathroom and later died at St. Luke&rsquo;s Hospital in Eldoret.The lawyer who was accompanied by his elder brother and his lawyer Tom Okundi to the LSK twelve days after his disappearance explained that he was hiding after he noted that his life was in danger. Lilan disappeared soon after addressing the media in Eldoret town claiming that his life was in danger, his family came forward to claim that he could not be traced.&quot;He took a private means to Nairobi on the same day of Too&#39;s burial for fear of his life, since then he has been hiding at undisclosed house in Nairobi,&quot; said Okundi.LSK Chief Executive Officer Mercy Wambua confirmed to the Standard that the lawyer had presented himself to the lawyers&rsquo; headquarters and had assured them that he was well.
