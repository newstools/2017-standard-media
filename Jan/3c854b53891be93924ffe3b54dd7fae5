All Government institutions, including counties, will soon be required to comprehensively evaluate projects to assess if they provide value for money.Projects found to drain taxpayer&rsquo;s funds without a return on investment will either be scrapped or re-engineered.Planning Principal Secretary&nbsp;Saitoti Torome said the Devolution Ministry is working on a policy that will require all Government agencies, as well as county governments, to undertake periodic monitoring and evaluation that will inform continued implementation of different projects. He said while such evaluation is critical, it has been largely ignored by most Government institutions.The PS said a majority of Government agencies that have carried out monitoring and evaluation of projects, do it line with guidelines by institutions financing such projects as opposed to being an internal requirement.&ldquo;The Government is in the process of coming up with the Kenya National Monitoring and Evaluation Policy. Once approved and adopted, it will serve as a basis for establishing systems and processes within Government for continuously evaluating projects being implementing,&rdquo; he said.

Mr Torome said the policy is in the final stages of being approved by various Government organisations.
