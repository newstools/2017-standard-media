Former President Daniel arap Moi yesterday shed some light on his close relationship with the late Mark Too.In his condolence message delivered by Baringo Senator Gideon Moi, the retired President said he noticed Too&#39;s natural flair for diplomacy and quick grasp of political dynamics and alignments as soon as he met him. &quot;I met him when he was a young man in rural Nandi. After noticing his potential, I mentored him from this rural simplicity to what is currently in the public domain,&quot; said Moi.Under Moi&#39;s mentorship, Too went on to excel in his natural flair for diplomacy fused with an immense sense of humour, and delivered on numerous assignments that the former president entrusted to him.&nbsp;&quot;He was an affable and personable gentleman with a natural flair for diplomacy. This flair, when fused with his immense sense of humour, stood him in good stead whenever I sent him to undertake certain missions,&quot; said Moi.
