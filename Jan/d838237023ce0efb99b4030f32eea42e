If mattresses were stored in this room, yet there are no traces of burnt matresses, it may mean somebody must have removed whatever he or she needed from the house before setting it ablaze,&quot; said Maurice Achok, a parent at the school.&quot;It is also unfortunate that all the boxes, which were kept in the adjacent room, have all been opened and some books and other vital belongings are missing,&quot; added another parent, Rashid Chirimba.The parents said they were forced to buy new books and other learning material after the previous fire incident, as the school only provided mattresses.Principal Hezron Oyolla declined to comment on the matter, saying he was on transfer.
