We have done more than what has not been achieved since independence,&quot; Ruto told the crowd.Ruto appeared incensed by&nbsp;remarks by Dr Wamalwa who said Jubilee should stop wasting time luring residents of Trans Nzoia who he calimed were deeply in the Opposition.Dr Wamalwa told Ruto to his face that Jubilee has no room in Trans Nzoia singling out his Kiminini constituency.&quot;Your Excellency, we love you and we appreciate development projects initiated by the Jubilee government in the county but the truth of the matter is that this is an opposition zone and JP should stop wasting time luring residents,&quot; Wamalwa told the DP.

That is your personal statement and does not represent the feeling of the locals,&quot; Ruto hit at the MP.At one moment, a furious Ruto told off a Ford Kenya youth who tried to shout down Women representative Janet Nangabo.&quot;Who forced you to attend this meeting? You should have stayed away at your home instead of coming to heckle leaders,&quot; Ruto retorted before his convoy left for Kitalale.Nangabo accused Dr Wamalwa of &#39;planning the heckling attack&#39; on the DP and termed the incident as &#39;primitive&#39;.&quot;How can you do this? This is unacceptable. It is primitive to incite youth to humiliate other elected leaders,&quot; a visibly angry Nangabo told Dr Wamalwa in local dialect.
