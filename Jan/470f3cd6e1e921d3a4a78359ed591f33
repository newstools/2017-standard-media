Nzoia Sugar Managing Director Godfrey Wanyonyi and six senior managers have been suspended following accusations of misuse of funds.The firm&#39;s board took the drastic decision barely four days after the said officers were arraigned in a Bungoma court to answer to fraud charges over a Sh11.2 million loss.Senior managers affected are Chief Cashier John Wanyonyi, Kennedy Onyango (accountant), Ben Sitati (cashier), Robert Juma (general manager), Kennedy Wanjala and Juliet Ng&#39;ang&#39;a (clerks). Board Chairman Joash Wamang&#39;oli yesterday revealed that the seven were suspended for alleged gross misconduct. A meeting by the board to discuss the said officials went on despite a court order seeking to have it stopped. Mr Wamang&#39;oli said the order was time barred but acknowledged receiving it.He said the decision had already been reached and could not be reversed. The court order had been obtained by a farmer, Juma Sikuta.&quot;We don&#39;t recognise this court order. Its content is irrelevant and it has arrived late when the decision to suspend the seven has been made. It can&#39;t be reversed now,&quot; Wamang&#39;oli declared.
