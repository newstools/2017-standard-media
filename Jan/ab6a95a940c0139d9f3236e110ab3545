&nbsp;The Government has asked lecturers of public universities to call off their strike to give room to negotiations.Education Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i urged universities to suspend their court cases to give room for discussions through the Joint Negotiations Committee. The talks are scheduled to start on Monday. &quot;We have placed before the union a request to suspend any industrial action until March 1, to enable us complete the negotiations on the 2013-2017 CBA (collective bargaining agreement),&quot; said Dr Matiang&#39;i.He added: &quot;Through consultations with my colleagues I have asked all university councils of public universities to immediately cease any actions that would jeopardise these discussions including any possible disciplinary action that they were thinking about and communication they have made in that regard and any court actions contemplated or planned within that kind of framework.&quot;The universities, through the Inter Public Universities Council Consultative Forum (IPUCCF), had filed a petition seeking to stop the ongoing strike claiming it was unconstitutional.
