They are remorseful and they have children who have not seen them for a quite a while.&quot;Considering they have been in custody for three years, they have suffered, which is enough correction,&rdquo; said the defence lawyer.Senior Resident Magistrate Irene Ruguru said the prosecution had provided enough evidence beyond reasonable doubt to show that the explosives were found between clothes in a suitcase in their rented house in Likoni.She however exonerated the couple from four charges they were facing for lack of evidence.
