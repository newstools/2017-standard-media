The quest to have many people register as voters has come with rather unusual measures to boost the voters&#39; roll.At Kapkoi market in Kwanza constituency, Trans-Nzoia County, a farmer is giving free maize to those who have registered as voters. This has resulted in long queues as locals line up to register so as not to miss the 2kg of maize being offered.Benson Kiteru has several bags of maize meant for residents who turn up for the voter listing. &quot;I realised that the turn out has been low since the exercise started and decided to donate maize to encourage people to register,&quot; said Kiteru, who clarified that he has no political interests.Only those who produced a voter&#39;s card were given maize. Most beneficiaries described the donation as a &#39;wonderful gift&#39; considering the drought that has led to increase in food prices.The cost of maize has shot up following persistent drought, with a 2kg tin selling at between Sh80 and Sh100 in the region.
