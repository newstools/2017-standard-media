Nairobi gubernatorial aspirant Peter Kenneth says he is ready for dialogue with camps in Jubilee that are opposed to his candidature.He, however, warned that should they not see the need for dialogue and consensus, he is not afraid to face them during party primaries.Mr Kenneth, who announced his candidature early this month, was speaking in Westlands where he met over 500 aspirants for various positions on Jubilee ticket. He said he was focussed on sending the incumbent Governor Evans Kidero home but warned Jubilee aspirants against scoring &quot;an own goal&quot; by not uniting.&quot;Insults and threats will not move me because I have thick skin but we need to work together to send Kidero home,&quot; said Kenneth.The former presidential aspirant hit out at Kidero for claiming he was eyeing the governorship after failing State House race in 2013 election.
