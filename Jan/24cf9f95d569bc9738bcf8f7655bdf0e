Prime Minister Narendra Modi has overturned a Supreme Court ban on a bull-wrestling festival that fuelled massive protests in southern India by demonstrators who called it an attack on their culture.India&#39;s Supreme Court outlawed the Jallikattu festival last year after a plea by animal rights groups, which have long accused participants in the event -- held every year in different parts of southern Tamil Nadu state -- of cruelty to the animals.Tensions have escalated in recent days as thousands of protesters gathered in state capital Chennai and other cities, prompting Tamil Nadu&#39;s chief minister to travel to Delhi to ask Modi to overturn the ban, which he did late Friday. &quot;We are very proud of the rich culture of Tamil Nadu. All efforts are being made to fulfil the cultural aspirations of Tamil people,&quot; Modi posted on Twitter on Saturday.The Tamil Nadu governor is expected to approve Modi&#39;s executive order later in the day, paving the way for Jallikattu to resume as early as Sunday.Critics say that organisers lace the bulls&#39; feed with liquor to make them less steady on their feet and throw chilli powder in their faces to send them into a sudden frenzy as they are released from a holding pen.
