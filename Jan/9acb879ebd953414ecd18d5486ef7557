Two governors have one last chance to submit their responses in a case in which they are accused of encroaching on Lake Victoria.Justice Stephen Kibunja gave governors Jack Ranguma (Kisumu) and Evans Kidero (Nairobi), and a senior official in the Ministry of Lands, Alice Kudia, the last chance to respond to a case barring them from starting construction work on the wetlands.Michael Nyanguti, the complainant, claimed that the three owned swathes of land around Lake Victoria. Mt Nyanguti said Mr Ranguma owned two plots in Kisumu&#39;s Korando region while Dr Kidero owned seven. He claimed Dr Kudia owned two plots in Kogony.The hearing failed to kick off for the second time yesterday as the accused were yet to respond to the suit papers.Sam Onyango, a lawyer representing the governors, asked the court to give his clients two more weeks to file their responses.

Yet a wetland area has been fenced off by the defendants,&quot; said Nyanguti.He requested the court to visit the wetlands the defendants had encroached to see the severity of the case.
