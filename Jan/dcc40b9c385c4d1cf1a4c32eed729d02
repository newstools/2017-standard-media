Jubilee Party (JP) and Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (CORD) are headed for another clash over the role of electoral body in party primaries.JP has indicated that it will invite the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) to conduct its party nominations, but the opposition thinks it is unworkable.The opposition argues that there is no legal framework to address how IEBC will conduct internal party primaries and who will fund the exercise. For instance, CORD says should a dispute arise from any party primary conducted by IEBC, an appeal goes straight to the elections disputes tribunal therefore bypassing the party appeals structure.This, they claim, is not only a violation of various electoral laws but also internal party constitution which provides internal dispute resolution mechanism.The opposition party said the political parties disputes tribunal has no jurisdiction to handle nomination disputes as the jurisdiction is vested in the commission pursuant to Article 88 of the Constitution and can not be donated.
