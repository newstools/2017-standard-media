The number of students suspended for a four year period by the Kirinyaga University for allegedly boycotting lectures in November last year has risen to 41 after six others got served with their letters.Among the six were Gideon Kipkosgei, a fourth year Bachelor of Commerce student who received his suspension letter last Friday and without being accorded an opportunity to defend himself as happened to the rest. The University first suspended 35 students who raged from those in first year to those in their final years, meaning they if ever resume studies in 2021.Trouble started at the recently Chartered University in November last year after the students boycotted lectures accusing the institution of hiking school fees unilaterally without giving their parents prior notice.They have also accused the institution of high handedness and making decisions affecting their learning without involving them as stipulated in the constitution.The students on Monday sent to the Education Cabinet Secretary Dr Fred Matingi a protest letter through their lawyer Magee wa Magee urging for his urgent intervention over the punitive punishment. They gave the institution a seven day ultimatum to revoke the suspensions or have the matter contested in a court of law for allegedly violating their fundamental rights.Their suspension letters were signed by the University Deputy Vice Chancellor in charge of Administration and Students Affairs Professor Charles Omwadho.A KTN crew was on Monday frogmarched from the institution by some ruthless security guards who claimed they had strict instructions not to allow in any outsider.University Vice Chancellor Professor Mary Wairimu Ndungu despite receiving our phone contacts through which to respond to the issues raised by the students has remained mum since.
