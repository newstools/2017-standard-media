The rivalry between Deputy President William Ruto and Baringo Senator Gideon Moi has climbed a notch higher after the former prevailed on a candidate to challenge the senator in the August elections.Betting Control and Licensing Board member Simon Chelugui, who was seen as a frontrunner for the governor&#39;s seat in the county, was last Tuesday forced to abandon his quest and go for the Senate seat instead. During a meeting at Mr Ruto&#39;s Sugoi home, Mr Chelugui dropped his quest for the governorship, to the shock of his supporters who took to social media to vent their anger.The Tuesday meeting was a follow-up of another held earlier where over 1,000 Baringo residents were invited to Ruto&#39;s home, where the DP and elected county leaders put pressure on Chelugui to step down from contesting the governorship and instead challenge Gideon.&quot;The DP was very clear that Gideon had to be tamed and the only person to face him was Chelugui. This was supported by all leaders present,&quot; said a Bernard Kipruto, who was among those who attended the meeting.

Various ideas, proposals and approaches were discussed and a way forward developed,&quot; he said.
