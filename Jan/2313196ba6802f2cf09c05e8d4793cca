&nbsp;NAIVASHA: Nine years after the deadly post-election violence that hit the country leaving a trail of death and destruction, victims of the Naivasha violence say they are yet to get any assistance from the State.And months to the general elections, the victims have threatened to boycott the exercise until the government compensates them just like other communities. This emerged when the representatives of the over 4,500 Naivasha integrated IDPs addressed the press in Naivasha and narrated their harrowing stories.According to the group chairman Samuel Odour, the government had released Sh6B towards resettling and compensating IDPs across the country but they had never benefitted.He said that Naivasha was one of the hardest hit towns by the post-election violence but the victims were forgotten.
