&nbsp;{Photo:Courtesy}Washington: The White House vowed on Sunday to fight the news media &quot;tooth and nail&quot; over what it sees as unfair attacks, with a top adviser saying the Trump administration had presented &quot;alternative facts&quot; to counter low inauguration crowd estimates.On his first full day as president, Trump said he had a &quot;running war&quot; with the media and accused journalists of underestimating the number of people who turned out Friday for his swearing-in. White House officials made clear no truce was on the horizon on Sunday in television interviews that set a much harsher tone in the traditionally adversarial relationship between the White House and the press corps.&quot;The point is not the crowd size. The point is the attacks and the attempt to delegitimize this president in one day. And we&#39;re not going to sit around and take it,&quot; Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said on &quot;Fox News Sunday.&quot;The sparring with the media has dominated Trump&#39;s first weekend in office, eclipsing debate over policy and Cabinet appointments.

The report on Friday night was quickly corrected, but Trump called out the reporter by name during a visit to the Central Intelligence Agency on Saturday. Spicer also berated the reporter later in the day.&nbsp;RUSSIAN SHADOWSWith the Nov. 8 election results shadowed by U.S. intelligence reports of Russian meddling on his behalf, Trump has bristled at reports suggesting his popular support is soft and that the election was not legitimate.

He praised his nominee to head the agency, Mike Pompeo, and ranted against the &quot;dishonest&quot; media, a favorite target during his presidential campaign.The president accused the media of fabricating his tensions with the U.S. intelligence community, despite his frequent posts on Twitter that derided the agencies.Trump drew criticism from Democrats as well as former CIA Director John Brennan for his remarks at the agency, where he spoke before a memorial wall with stars representing personnel killed in action.&quot;President Trump ought to realize he&#39;s not campaigning anymore. He&#39;s president,&quot; Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said on ABC&#39;s &quot;This Week.&quot;&quot;Instead of talking about how many people showed up at his inauguration, he ought to be talking about how many people are going to stay in the middle class and move into the middle class.&quot;
