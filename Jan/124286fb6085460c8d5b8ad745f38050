Deputy President William Ruto encountered hostility for a second time during his tour of Western region.Just a day after ODM and Ford-Kenya supporters blocked Ruto and Governor Ken Lusaka from accessing Bungoma Town on Monday, the DP had to endure heckling as he attempted to address residents of Trans Nzoia County yesterday.A chopper carrying Ruto had to land at Kitale Members Club and not Masaba Primary as planned after Opposition supporters barricaded the road leading to the school. On Monday, Ruto and Lusaka were forced take another route to Kanduyi stage, skipping Bungoma, where Jubilee leaders had been scheduled to address the public at a bus park.Tension was high in Kiminini Town, Ruto&rsquo;s first stop as Opposition and Jubilee supporters engaged in a shouting match that turned violent at some point but security officers, led by County Commissioner Ann Gakuria, were at hand to maintain order.The NASA-chanting crowd burst into song and dance as area MP Chris Wamalwa of Ford Kenya made his way into Kiminini stage. Ruto braved the hostile reception and joined the MP.

That is your personal statement and does not represent the feeling of the locals,&rdquo; Ruto said.Woman Representative Janet Nangabo accused Wamalwa of sponsoring youths to heckle them.

They are like a team that is blaming the shape of the ball, size of goal posts and referee yet they are unprepared,&rdquo; said Ruto, who spoke later at Maili Nane in Cherangany Constituency.
