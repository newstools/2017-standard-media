They are simply showing how desperate they are and their actions have only served to take away the little support they had in Meru,&quot; said Munya.This came as Senator Majority Leader Kithure Kindiki launched a scathing attack against the governor who he said should be replaced in the August 8 elections.Kindiki urged locals to elect Kiraitu as governor, noting Munya is among governors who see themselves as &quot;being too big&quot;.&nbsp; ALSO READ: Peter Kenneth warns against Jubilee infighting&quot;While MPs and senators are fighting for funds for their regions, some governors think they are too big and have even gone ahead to form their own parties,&quot; said Kindiki.The governor accused a section of Jubilee leaders of malice.&quot;It is sad that this kind of thuggery is happening in our society today even after I called off functions on Saturday in honour of President Kenyatta&#39;s visit. It is a reflection of political intolerance by people who have no regard for democracy,&quot; Munya said.During President Kenyatta&#39;s visit, Jubilee members, including Titus Ntuchiu who is a running mate to one of the candidates in the gubernatorial race, told Munya to keep off the affairs of the President&#39;s party.But Imenti North OCPD Sam Kosgei said no case of vandalism had been reported. &quot;I am waiting for the aggrieved party to come and make an official report before we can investigate the matter,&quot; Kosgei said.Jubilee and PNU have been involved in a supremacy battle in the region for some time now. Things worsened when Munya declined to dissolve his party to Join JP.Munya has vowed his party will field candidates for all positions, except the presidency, where they will support Mr Kenyatta&#39;s re-election bid. This has not gone down well with Jubilee generals who feel the presence of PNU is undermining Jubilee in a region perceived to be the President&#39;s stronghold.
