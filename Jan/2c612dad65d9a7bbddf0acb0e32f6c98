The&nbsp;dons are pressing the government to honour a Collective Bargaining Agreement (CBA) that was signed in 2015 which has not yet been implemented.Employment and Labour Relations Court had earlier blocked public university lecturers from participating in the strike which they have ignored and proceeded with their planned industrial action.
