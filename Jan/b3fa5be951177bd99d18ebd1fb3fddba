ISIOLO, KENYA: North Eastern leaders wants the government to scale up livestock take off programme by expanding its reach to far-flung areas in the region.Speaking to the press in Modogashe town, after touring areas in his constituency hardest ravaged by prevailing dry spell, Lagdera MP Mohamed Shidiye said majority of the pastoralists who have been badly affected by the drought are in remote locations in the rural areas.He said that weak and emaciated animals in far flung areas cannot make into urban center where livestock are being brought to be purchased by Kenya meat commission. &quot;How do you tell headers who are over 100 KMs from the market in towns to bring their already weak animals for sale without considering how the weak animal will trek that long distance? Let KMC which is leading the programme use the chiefs and their assistants in identifying headers with emaciated animals and then the buyers should go into those areas,&quot; said Shidiye.Shidiye said that even though the president meant good for pastoralists by launching the animal off take exercise, there are chances that it might not help the intended persons if the programme is not well coordinated.
