Jubilee leaders have threatened not to vote for the government unless peace and security is restored along the border of West Pokot and Turkana counties.This comes after three people were shot dead at Amolem village on Wednesday by suspected bandits who took off immediately without stealing livestock.Led by Sigor legislator Philip Rotino, the leaders have condemned the killings and appealed to Government to intervene. Speaking in Amolen, Rotino stated that the ongoing voter registration exercise has not yet kicked off in the entire Masol ward because of insecurity.&quot;Nobody is going to vote here if this government of President Uhuru Kenyatta and his deputy William Ruto still require the votes, they should intervene and try to disarm the suspects,&quot; he said.He claimed that the bullets that were used to kill the young men were from the government armory hence suspected the Kenya Police Reservists for colluding with bandits who are also supplied with guns to kill people.

Kuto said more police camps are being set up in the area and police officers are patrolling day and night to curb insecurity.Sekerr ward MCA Thomas Ngolesia asked residents to fish out the wrong doers and the government to investigate the bullets that were used to kill the people if they were from the government.
