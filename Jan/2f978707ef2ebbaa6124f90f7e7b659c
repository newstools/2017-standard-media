It is rush against time as parents in Nakuru flock shops to buy books, uniforms and stationery in preparation for opening of schools tomorrow.Hundreds of parents moved from one shop to another looking for necessary items for their children after a long a Christmas holiday. While some of the parents had done shopping for their children while on holiday, others waited for the last minute and are forced to dig deeper into their pockets given that the prices of most commodities have gone up.Speaking to The Standard, Shadrack Ochieng&rsquo; who is a parent said life is becoming hard with the increase in prices for learning materials, forcing parents to choose other alternatives.Ochieng said parents have opted for second hand books sold in the streets as new books were expensive.

The number of customers visiting his premise he said had rose compared to Christmas holidays.Kichana who has been in the business for 16 years said he has helped many parents and students as they could acquire books at low prices.&quot;Parents whose children have completed one level and joining another bring me their children&#39;s books and I exchange them at a fee for books to their next level,&quot; he said.

It was revealed that bus fares to most parts of the country from Nakuru have been increased.Parents are now calling on the Cabinet Minister Ministry of Education to streamline the issue of fees as some schools are charging more than what is expected despite directives and guidelines by the Ministry.
