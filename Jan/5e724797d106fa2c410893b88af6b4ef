Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX plans to resume flying rockets next week following an investigation into why one of them burst into flames on a launch pad four months ago, the company said on Monday.In a statement, SpaceX said it expected to launch a Falcon 9 rocket from California&#39;s Vandenberg Air Force Base on Jan. 8 to put 10 satellites into orbit for Iridium Communications Inc.SpaceX had suspended flights after the same model rocket went up in a blaze on Sept. 1 as it was being fueled for a routine pre-launch test in Florida. The explosion at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida destroyed the $62 million rocket and a $200 million communications satellite.Space X, owned and operated by Tesla Motors Inc. Chief Executive Officer Musk, has a backlog of more than 70 missions for NASA and commercial customers, worth more than $10 billion.The company statement said that accident investigators concluded that a canister of helium inside the rocket&rsquo;s upper-stage oxygen tank had exploded.In the short term, SpaceX plans to revamp its fueling procedures so that the super-cold liquid oxygen will not build up between the helium tank&rsquo;s liner and its outer covering, it added.SpaceX said accumulation of oxygen in a void or buckle in the liner most likely led to the explosion.&ldquo;In the long term, SpaceX will implement design changes to the (helium canisters) to prevent buckles altogether,&rdquo; the statement said.The company did not say when new helium canisters would be ready to fly, but that using warmer temperature helium and a slower fueling operation will prevent them from bursting.&ldquo;Iridium is pleased with SpaceX&rsquo;s announcement on the results of the September 1 anomaly as identified by their accident investigation team, and their plans to target a return to flight,&rdquo; company spokeswoman Diane Hockenberry said in a statement.SpaceX has not said how much damage the Sept. 1 accident did to its primary Florida launch pad, nor when a new second pad in Florida, located at NASA&rsquo;s Kennedy Space Center, will be put into service.
