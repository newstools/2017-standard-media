Washington: Exclusive: Trump administration to allow 872 refugees into US&nbsp;this week - documentThe US&nbsp;government has granted waivers to let 872 refugees into the country this week, despite President Donald Trump&#39;s executive order on Friday temporarily banning entry of refugees from any country, according to an internal Department of Homeland Security document seen by Reuters.A Homeland Security official, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed the waivers, noting that the refugees were considered &quot;in transit&quot; and had already been cleared for resettlement before the ban tookeffect. Refugees preparing for resettlement typically have severed personal ties and relinquished their possessions, leaving them particularly vulnerable if their plans to depart are suddenly canceled.The waivers, granted by the State Department and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), came amid international protests against Trump&#39;s rushed executive order. Critics said the order in some cases was not clearly communicated to the agencies responsible for implementing it.It was not known if additional waivers would be granted, the official said. The document did not give the nationalities of the refugees who will be admitted into the United States.

In addition, more than 200 people landed in the United States but were denied entry, the document showed.More than 735 people were pulled aside for questioning by US&nbsp;Customs and Border Protection officers in airports, including 394 legal permanent US&nbsp;residents holding green cards, over the same time period.Trump said the executive order he signed on Friday was designed to protect the United States &quot;from foreign terrorist entry.&quot;The order stopped all refugee admissions for 120 days while government officials determine how to ensure that any refugees admitted do not pose a threat.The 872 refugees to be admitted this week, under the waivers, were screened using Obama administration procedures, which typically take two years and include several interviews and a background check.

Democratic Senator Dianne Feinstein said she had 27 co-sponsors for the legislation. But under Senate rules it takes only one member to prevent a vote, and Republican Senator Tom Cotton blocked consideration of the measure.The Democrats&#39; leader in the US&nbsp;Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would bring legislation on Monday evening seeking to end the ban, although the measure stood little chance of being passed by the Republican-led Congress.
