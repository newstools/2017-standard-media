The newly-appointed electoral commissioners have pledged to be impartial and fair while executing their mandate.Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) chairman Wafula Chebukati said his new team&#39;s interest is to serve the nation and ensure that the August General Election is free, fair, credible and transparent.&quot;We are not here for selfish pursuit but to serve this nation,&quot; said the IEBC chairman. At a prayer breakfast meeting with IEBC staff yesterday, Chebukati and the new team sought divine intervention before embarking on delivering credible elections.Aware that there are only 195 days left to the elections, the commissioners made frantic efforts to get updates on the ongoing voter registration among other issues.By yesterday evening, they were still in consultation with the secretariat headed by Ezra Chiloba who is also the commission secretary. The tight programme forced them to call off an earlier planned briefing scheduled for today.

They are being addressed and a comprehensive communication will be made by the commissioners tomorrow (today),&quot; said Limo.&quot;It has since been established that some voters attempt to confirm their records shortly after registering or applying to transfer polling stations,&quot; IEBC had said in a statement.
