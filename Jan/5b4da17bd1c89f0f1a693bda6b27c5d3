The Kenya tsetse and trypanosomiasis eradication council (Kenntec) has dispatched more than 50 technical officers across various counties to fight resurgence of tsetse menace through spraying of animals and sensitisation on better tsetse eradication practices.This comes after the prolonged drought caused by failed short rains which were due late last year. &ldquo;In such times, tsetse prevalence is usually very high in most affected areas; mostly transmitted as pastoralists move from place to place &nbsp;looking for greener grazing grounds for their livestock,&rdquo; said Kenttec Chairman David Wanyonyi.Kenttec is involved in upgrading of livestock in areas freed of Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis through training of Artificial Insemination (AI) service providers, embryo transfer technology, sexed semen and establishment of Biofarms which in the long run is going to improve the current state of livestock and further create awareness to the larger public.Currently, most affected areas include the coastal region and some parts of north eastern.
