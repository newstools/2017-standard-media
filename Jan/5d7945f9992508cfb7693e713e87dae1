They were speaking at the Anglican Church of Kenya (ACK), Ruai, Nairobi during a church service.Dr Kidero, who is running on a CORD ticket, told Mr Kenneth that he was ready to face him &quot;after you solve your in-house issues in Jubilee.&quot;&quot;You need to be careful. The last time you went for the presidential seat, now you have gone for governor seat. You should be careful lest you contest for ward rep in the next election. However, let us meet in the field after you get the Jubilee nomination,&quot; Kidero told his opponent.
