It is alleged the officers forced the complainants out of a car they were travelling in and threatened to shoot them if they raised the alarm.They are alleged to have conspired with a taxi driver, Wilson Kamau, to steal the money without raising any suspicions.The court has ordered the arrest of Mr Kamau after he jumped bail and failed to appear in court Wednesday.Police said they recovered only Sh135,000 out of the total amount stolen.The two police officers were released on a surety bond of Sh1 million each pending the mention of their case on February 8.Last year, Administration Police officers Fredrick ole Leliman, Stephen Morogo, Sylvia Wanjohi and Leonard Maina were charged with the murders of lawyer Willie Kimani, his client Josephat Mwenda and taxi driver Joseph Muiruri.Well-planned execution ALSO READ: History made as train engines roar to life in MombasaThe prosecution told the court the killings were committed in Soweto, Mlolongo, Machakos County, on the night of June 23, 2016. The murder trial is set for next month.During the hearing last November, Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions Nicholas Mutuku narrated in court the details of the horrific killings in the middle of an open field on the outskirts of Nairobi.&ldquo;This was a well-planned execution that would have easily succeeded were it not for technology and Willie Kimani&rsquo;s attempt to solicit for help by writing on a piece of toilet paper and squeezing it out of the cell where they were being held at Syokimau Police Post,&rdquo;&nbsp; Mr Mutuku told the court.The court heard that one of the accused, Peter Kamau, who at the time was a police informer, offered to spill the beans after he was arrested, and linked his co-accused to the murders.The dispute that led to the deaths began in April 2015, when Leliman shot and arrested Mwendwa, who at the time was a boda boda rider, and later charged him in a Mavoko court with being in possession of bhang, resisting arrest and gambling, the prosecution told the court.&ldquo;Mwendwa was aggrieved and reported the matter to the Independent Police Oversight Authority and sought help from the International Justice Mission. It was at this point that the AP officer felt his job was at risk and hatched a plot to eliminate Mwendwa,&rdquo; said Mutuku.In May this year, Leliman involved Kamau in the plot he had hatched with Maina to eliminate Mwendwa. Kamau&rsquo;s task was to monitor and report Mwenda&rsquo;s movements. He was given a mobile handset with an unregistered SIM card for communication.

Their bodies were later discovered in a river.The prosecution has told the court that analyses of mobile phone communications had proved that all the accused persons were in constant touch and were at the specific places mentioned on the fateful day. The prosecution has 60 witnesses lined up.Three days after Kimani&rsquo;s disappearance, Elizabeth Kinuthia, his mother, dreamt he was dead. She said in the dream, she told him: &ldquo;My son, if it is a deadly matter, go in peace.&rdquo;
