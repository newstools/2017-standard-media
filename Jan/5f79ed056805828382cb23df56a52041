The electoral commission has been directed to extend the date of&nbsp; opening the Kenya Integrated Elections Management (KIEMS) tender by two weeks.The Public Procurement and Disposal Administrative Review Board (PPDARB) said the&nbsp;Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) flouted procurement laws. Consequently, the board, which included Paul Gicheru (chairman) and members Peter Ondieki, Nelson Orgut, Rosemary Gituma and Hussein Were, ruled that IEBC extend the period to allow full participation by all bidders.The board has been hearing a complaint by some local and international bidders who wanted the KIEMS tender nullified and re-advertised, citing irregularities.KIEMS includes biometric voter registration, voter identification, electronic results transmission and candidate registration systems.

This is to ensure full participation by all potential bidders as are desirous of participating in this tender process,&quot; the board ruled.IEBC has also been ordered to immediately place an advertisement in the print, electronic or other media informing the public of the orders and the directions of the board.Kenya-based Dittel Ltd, African Infrastructure Development Company, and South African firm BigRadap (BG) noted the tender was flawed.
