Suspected thugs broke into the house of Kilifi Governor Amason Kingi in Nyali and made away with a laptop and TV set Friday.The burglars are said to have switched off an electric fence and jumped over two homes in a gated area and got into the governor&#39;s house. The Governor said the thugs broke into his house at around 3am.&quot;I could hear them all over the house breaking down doors,&quot; explained Kingi. He was at home with his wife and children during the ordeal. Governor Kingi and his family barricaded themselves in the bedroom as the attackers broke down the kitchen door, apparently, using a crowbar or other heavy equipment, and rummaged through rooms in an operation that lasted about half an hour.&quot;I could hear them right outside my bedroom door,&quot; Kingi said.Kisauni OCPD Christopher Rotich in a statement, announced that detectives have launched a probe into the matter.
