Local hockey clubs have a great chance to make the country proud by winning silverware at the Africa Cup for Club Championships, which kicked off in Nairobi yesterday.While Telkom Orange will be hoping to defend the women&rsquo;s title they won last year, local men&rsquo;s clubs Butali Sugar Warriors and Kenya Police will be up against stronger rivals, particularly from North Africa. Egyptian clubs have dominated in the men&rsquo;s category and defending champions Sharkia are considered runaway favourties, having won the competition a record 23 times.However, Butali and Police are well prepared so let&rsquo;s egg them on to victory. Women champions Telkom Orange cannot afford to be complacent &mdash; they must give everything they&rsquo;ve got to retain the cup.Let&rsquo;s wish our teams every success and pray that they bring both cups home.&nbsp;
