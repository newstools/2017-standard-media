Wellness products firm Procter and Gamble (P&amp;G) in partnership with World Vision has committed to provide clean drinking water to 12 counties across Kenya.The initiative will see P&amp;G invest Sh50 million, with World Vision as the implementation partner. It is part of P&amp;G&rsquo;s Children&rsquo;s Safe Drinking Water (CSDW) programme that has been running in Kenya for over 10 years. The programme utilises P&amp;G Purifier of Water sachets, which use low-cost powdered technology, designed to purify even heavily contaminated drinking water to meet World Health Organisation standards for safe drinking water.The P&amp;G Purifier of Water was invented by the firm&rsquo;s scientists in collaboration with the US Centre for Disease Control and Prevention, with each four-gramme packet of P&amp;G water purifier turning 10 litres of dirty, potentially deadly water into clean and drinkable water in minutes. &ldquo;If everyone everywhere had clean water, the number of diarrheal deaths would be cut by 34 per cent,&rdquo; said P&amp;G Kenya Managing Director Vivek Sunder in a statement.
