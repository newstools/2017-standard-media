Nairobi, Kiambu and Kilifi are the leading counties in the number of new voters registered so far.Of the 825,145 new electors listed in the first week of the mass voter registration, Nairobi is leading with 95,966 ahead of Kiambu (61,541), Kilifi (38,339), Nakuru (35, 815) and Meru (33,285).However, the number is below the weekly target of 1.4 million new voters the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) set for itself. Meanwhile, Mombasa listed 28,618 new voters while Murang&#39;a has 26,393. Others are Kakamega (25,451) and Bungoma (21,331) as Kisumu closed the top 10 counties with 21,254 new registrations.Counties that registered the least number of voters are Lamu (2,169), Isiolo (2,243), Marsabit (2,722), Wajir (5,102) and Baringo (5,707).IEBC is hoping to list over 6 million new voters during the month-long exercise even though the country has 9 million people with identity cards who are yet to register.

We urge them to register and not wait until the last day. We will not extend this period,&quot; said IEBC chairman Wafula Chebukati.Mr Chebukati cited the drought currently ravaging most parts of the country and insecurity as some of the challenges they faced.&quot;The commission has received reports that drought in some counties has had a negative impact on voter registration due to the movement of people. We have also received reports of insecurity in some parts of the country, especially in Mandera, Pokot and Turkana,&quot; he said.Last week, there was reports of gun battles between the police and suspected Al-Shabaab terrorists at Jilomata Centre in Hulugho ward of Ijara Constituency. This affected voter registration.IEBC is also considering setting up mobile registration centres in colleges and universities. ALSO READ: Is there a plan to get rid of Joho?&quot;There are concerns about the registration of youths currently in colleges away from their voting areas. The commission is taking immediate measures to address the challenge, including considering the use of mobile registration centres,&quot; said the newly appointed chairman in his first address since assuming office.Flanked by IEBC&#39;s new commissioners, Chebukati noted an analysis conducted by the commission at the beginning of this month on the status of the voter register, which shows there are 128,926 shared registration documents (national ID and passport numbers), representing 0.8 per cent of the total number of voters in the database.The analysis further indicates the shared ID numbers could be the result of data entry errors at the time of registration, possible use of one ID to register more than once, attempted registration of more than one person using same ID or shared national ID numbers.Out of the 128,926 records of shared IDs, 107,777 show the same ID number but different names.A further analysis showed 53,671 of the IDs were shared more than once. The remaining 21,149 are for persons who attempted to register more than once at different polling stations.IEBC is now warning any individuals who might have registered twice or used a different person&#39;s ID.&quot;It is a criminal offence to register twice. Those found capable will face the law,&quot; said Chebukati.
