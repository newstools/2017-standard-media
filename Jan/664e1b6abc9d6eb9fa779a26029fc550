Governor Ken Lusaka has called on Bungoma people to come out in large numbers and register as voters from Monday next week.The County Boss said it was only through voting that members of the public can participate in the development of their county. &quot;We would like to see deserving leaders get an opportunity to serve the public. This can only be realised if we register as voters,&quot; he said.Speaking to the Standard in Beijing where he has been attending international meetings, Mr Lusaka observed that this year&#39;s political contest will be between two horses (Jubilee and Cord).&quot;I have served the people of Bungoma with total commitment. We have improved our roads, healthcare and education. We continue to invest more of the resources in sectors that will boost the living standards of our people.&quot;He added: &quot;These are milestones that will see my government voted back in August.&quot;The Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission rolls out a 30-day mass voter registration drive from January 16 to February 14, 2017.The exercise is meant to increase the number of registered voters by between four to six million. &quot;This will be the last opportunity for eligible Kenyan citizens to register as voters in the run-up to the August 8, 2017 General Election. Let&#39;s come out and get registered,&quot; added Mr Lusaka who jets back into the country tomorrow.
