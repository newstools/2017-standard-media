Leaders want the national government to set up proper structures to sustain heroes and heroines, and consider the elderly among them for the monthly stipend.Governor Moses Akaranga, Hamisi MP Charles Gimose, African Divine Church Archbishop John Chabuga and Central Maragoli Ward MCA Abdala Chogo said it was unfortunate that many heroes who had fought for the country&#39;s freedom were poor.&quot;After fighting for the country&#39;s pride in whatever sector of life, one should be honoured to the last day of his life. It is unfortunate that many of our national heroes have been beggars before their cries are heard,&quot; Mr Akaranga said. The leaders spoke at the requiem mass for decorated World War II veteran Joseph Inima, 100, who was buried at his Gisambai home on Saturday.&quot;The medals that some of these national heroes are given cannot put food on their tables; they need help,&quot; said Mr Chabuga.Mr Inima took pride in having been mandated by President Jomo Kenyatta to start the first National Youth Service (NYS) after the country attained independence. He was the first African NYS commandant in 1963, after his exploits in World War II.
