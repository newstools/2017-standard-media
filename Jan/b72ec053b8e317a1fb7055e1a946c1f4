Nakuru County plans to register all water vendors to protect residents from contaminated water during the ongoing drought.County public health officer Samuel King&rsquo;ori cautioned residents against dealing with unlicensed vendors who are taking advantage of the current shortage to hawk dirty water.Due to the shortage, locals have been buying water from vendors at between Sh50 and Sh80 per jerrycan. Speaking to The Standard at his office, Mr King&rsquo;ori said the vendors will be compelled to disclose the source of their water to prevent an outbreak of waterborne diseases. &ldquo;It has come to our attention that some water vendors are drawing water from contaminated sources,&rdquo; said King&rsquo;ori.King&rsquo;ori said most rivers that supply fresh water to the region have dried up.WATER PURIFIERSAmong rivers that have dried up are Makalia and Naishi that drain into Lake Nakuru. Levels at River Ndarugo, which has been a lifeline for many families in the area, have plummeted with the raging drought, as residents compete with car washing businesses for water.Areas facing acute water shortage include Lower Solai, Elementaita, Long&rsquo;onot and Gilgil.The public health official said his department is closely monitoring contents of water supplied to residents noting that some contained levels of fluoride that were a threat to human health.The health department is also distributing water purifiers to various villages that have in the past recorded an outbreak of waterborne diseases.&ldquo;Public health officers have been dispatched to supply locals with chlorine to ensure they access clean drinking water to avoid outbreak of diseases like cholera and typhoid,&rdquo; he said.Meanwhile, Nakuru Water Sewarage and Sanitation Company (Nawassco) has announced plans to start rationing water in Langa Langa, Freehold, Racecourse, Kenlands, Shabab, Pangani, Kwa Rhonda and Ponda Mali estates.&nbsp;
