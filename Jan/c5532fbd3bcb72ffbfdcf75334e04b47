The Makonde, who had been stateless for over half a century, have complained that processing of their identity cards has taken too long.They now fear that they might not register as voters so that they take part in the August polls. On November 25 last year, Interior Cabinet Secretary Joseph Nkaissery launched a process of identifying the Makonde as&nbsp;Kenyans and promised to issue them with identity cards&nbsp;before Christmas last year.The Government launched the registration of the community, whose ancestral home is Mozambique, following a study that estimated their numbers to be about 3,000.By mid December, just under 1,800 had been captured in&nbsp; Government data bases.
