Efforts to end the doctors&rsquo; strike have hit a major setback after the medics issued new conditions before stalled negotiations can resume.Thursday, the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) resolved not to engage in any negotiations with the Government if Health Cabinet Secretary Cleopa Mailu is part of it.The union also said there has to be a mediator in the talks &mdash; possibly the Kenya Medical Association or the Kenya National Commission on Human Rights (KNCHR). The medics also demanded that all sessions of the negotiations be done before the public for transparency.This renewed fight came after they were given a reprieve by the Industrial Court, which suspended union officials&rsquo; one-month sentence by a further five days.Doctors have laid blame on Dr Mailu, claiming he is the stumbling block to the negotiations that have to be re-started every time they stall.

It is either he resigns or he is sacked. But we cannot negotiate with people who have partisan interests,&rdquo; said KMPDU Secretary General Ouma Oluga.Suspension extendedHe added: &ldquo;It cannot be the CS wants to protect the interests of private sector that serves just one per cent of the population and leave out the rest.&rdquo;The new conditions were issued just after the doctors&rsquo; union officials appeared in court seeking an extension on their suspended sentence that was to expire Thursday.

The role of this court is to bring this impasse to a solution and so, I further suspend the earlier sentence by five days,&rdquo; said Wasilwa.Meanwhile, a blogger has filed an urgent suit to compel the Government to resolve the ongoing doctors&rsquo; strike.Robert Alai argued that failure by Mailu to resolve the two-month strike continues to hurt the poor by violating their constitutional right to health services.
