Former Lugari MP Cyrus Jirongo will not be charged over alleged Sh 50 million land fraud after High Court found legal gaps surrounding his prosecution.Justice George Odunga agreed with his argument that he was being unfairly dragged to court as the issue in contest happened two decades ago. Although the judge pointed out that he could not make a finding on whether Jirongo was innocent or not, he found that it had taken too long for the politician&#39;s accusers to launch a complaint with the police and at the same time Director of Public Prosecution Keriako Tobiko to make recommendation on him being charged. Justice Odunga termed it a persecution.&quot;Where a person whom against the wrong doing has been allegedly committed takes an inordinately long time before lodging his complaint with the police and as a result of which crucial evidence is lost and witnesses become unavailable amounts to nothing but persecution,&quot; ruled Justice Odunga.He noted that efforts to have the business man cum politician charged were a ploy to reclaim the property in question.
