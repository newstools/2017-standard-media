Residents of Butula sub-county in Busia yesterday stormed and burnt down Burinda Administration Police camp and the chief&#39;s office in a protest.The demonstration was sparked by the shooting dead of a boda boda rider by an AP officer. The rider is alleged to have knocked down a child in front of the AP camp before he was confronted by officers who were nearby.&quot;There was a minor accident in the morning and two officers intervened. Then there was some little argument and we heard a gunshot, only to realise the boda boda man had been shot,&quot; said Beatrice Achieng, a witness.&quot;We came here (police post) demanding to be told why they had shot the man but they turned against us,&quot; added another.
