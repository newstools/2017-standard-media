The health department has warned of a looming cholera outbreak in Kisumu as residents and livestock jostle for water.A prolonged dry spell in the area has reduced many streams into stagnant pools. County Health Chief Officer Ojwang Lusi said Cholera was more likely to start and spread fast with the low volumes of water in the county.&quot;When an outbreak occurs upstream when the water levels are low, it means that the bacteria become more concentrated in the water and thus a reason why it is likely to spread faster,&quot; he said.The drought, which has now entered its fifth month with negligible sparse rainfalls in between, has seen water levels in rivers Auji, Nyamasaria, Kibos and Nyando reduce tremendously.

The continued drying up of the river is a cause for alarm.&quot;We drink water from this river because we don&#39;t have access to piped water, which water vendors sell at exorbitant prices,&quot; she says.The health department called on residents who draw raw water from the drying rivers to either treat or boil it before use.
