A father who has offered to donate part of his liver to his three year old ailing daughter is appealing to Good Samaritans to offer a helping hand for his daughter to undergo a surgery in an Indian Hospital. Steve Abinja Ongaro, the father of Divine Blessing, who was a pupil at New Junior Campus school kindergarten, said his daughter needs surgery to replace her liver but the family cannot afford to raise the amount required for her medication.&quot;One&nbsp;evening, she complained of pains in her tummy. We took her to Nairobi Hospital where doctors suspected cancer originating from her liver after several tests,&quot; Ongaro says.Few weeks later, he added, Blessing complained of pains again and was admitted at Gertrude&#39;s hospital.Ongaro said: &quot;A scan revealed that there was a large mass (hepatoblastoma) that was growing in her liver, invading major blood vessels supplying blood to the liver and the right part of the heart. The doctors recommended an urgent surgery but was not conducted immediately due to inadequate medical cost.&quot;In October last year (2016), Blessing was referred to Forties Escorts hospital in India where she is still undergoing treatment. Doctors in the hospital stated liver transplant was the only option for her to lead a normal life.&quot;I have offered to give her a piece of my liver so that she may be able to live. We have exhausted our savings in settling medical bills and we appeal for well-wishers to help me raise Sh4million for her surgery,&quot; Ongaro appealed.
