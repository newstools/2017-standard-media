(Photo: Beverlyne Musili/Standard)Kitui Governor Julius Malombe has dismissed Senator David Musila&#39;s claim that Wiper leader Kalonzo Musyoka is interfering with the race for governor in the county.Mr Malombe told Mr Musila to apologise to Kalonzo, failing which he would seek his removal as party chairman. &quot;It is unfortunate that the senator has decided to drag Kalonzo&#39;s name into my competition with him for the governor&#39;s seat,&quot; Malombe said.&quot;Musila has committed a taboo by castigating his party boss. Kalonzo never said he supported me. He only expressed his desire that each one of us should stick to their line as governor and senator. Musila has simply sensed defeat and is now panicking,&quot; said Malombe.Addressing rallies in Mui ward, Mwingi Central constituency, the governor warned that Musila would wreck Kalonzo&#39;s presidential bid unless he was tamed.

We want to tell him to leave the governor&#39;s race to the electorate and concentrate on his presidential bid for his own good,&quot; said Musila, adding, &quot;Kalonzo had made it clear who he prefers as the Wiper candidate for the governor&#39;s seat.&quot;Thursday, Malombe, accompanied by among others, Mui MCA Stanislaus Mulongo, said: &quot;It was disrespectful for a leader of Musila&#39;s standing to use dirty language against Kalonzo. Kalonzo is not Musila&#39;s equal. He should tame his emotions and stop spoiling for our presidential candidate.&quot;During the rally, Kalonzo said he had asked Malombe and Musila to end their rivalry but his efforts have not borne fruit.
