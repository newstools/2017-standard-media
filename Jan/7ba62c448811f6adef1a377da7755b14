Jubilee supporters have promised to turn the tide against the Opposition before the August polls.The pro-Government front has for the past three months been busy drawing strategies aimed at overpowering their rivals in the area, which has previously been considered an Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) stronghold.The list of appointees from Nyamira County to public service jobs has been growing longer, with the pro-government campaigners believing it is a major strategy to win favour from locals. Besides the appointments, development projects such as roads, dams and hospitals are key areas where the Government is striving to win the hearts of the people.During his visit to the county on Sunday, Deputy President William Ruto gave residents of North Mugirango Sh300 million which he said will be used to enhance power connectivity.He further assured residents that roads in the area will be improved and upgraded to better standards, something he challenged the locals to try with the Opposition.
