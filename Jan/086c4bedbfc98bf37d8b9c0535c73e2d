The East African Community (EAC) is holding talks on expanding the one-area mobile network to cover all member states, an official has said.Francis Wangusi, Director General of the Communications Authority of Kenya, told a regional internet forum in Nairobi that currently, only Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan are members of the single mobile area network.&quot;We are currently in talks so that Tanzania and Burundi can also join the one-area mobile network where all calls amongst countries will be treated as domestic calls,&quot; Wangusi said. Kenya, Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan have formed a one-area network under the Northern Transport Corridor Network. When fully implemented, the network will reduce the cost of making calls across the trading bloc.&quot;The direct result is that volume of inter-country calls will increase and this will help to promote EAC regional integration efforts,&quot; Wangusi said.He said in order for the six-member EAC bloc to have a single network, some hurdles need to be overcome, including changing telecom legislations of Tanzania and Burundi.
