There was collective outrage and shock arising from the recent accident in Naivasha after a vehicle carrying flammable products exploded, the fire spreading to a number of vehicles and killing at least 40 people.Unfortunately, that outrage only occurs during such dramatic disasters, yet road traffic accidents now rival the devastation caused by malaria, Kenya&#39;s leading public health problem. Despite owning less than half of the world&#39;s vehicles, Africa&#39;s roads are the deadliest.Slipshod enforcement of traffic rules, bad roads and inadequate accident and emergency care services are some of the factors that make our roads risky. The data paints a miserable picture: of the 10 nations with the highest death rates, eight are African.Nine out of 10 of the approximately 1.3 million people who die on the roads each year come from poor and middle-income countries.

Yet that offers false comfort.

Sweden&#39;s roads are the world&#39;s safest.Only three of every 100,000 Swedes will have died in a road crash this year far lower than the average of 5.5 in the European Union or 1.4 in America.Kenya&#39;s death toll is 10 times that. Comparatively, Sweden has nearly double the size of cars in Kenya. So how has Sweden managed to save life and limb?First of all, the roads&#39; architecture in Sweden prioritises safety over speed or convenience.

That has saved lives.Ending the carnage on the road is not the task of one hawk-eyed policeman who doesn&#39;t take bribes from motorists, or the design of world class roads.No, it is about the joint efforts of all players, but mostly on the behavioural aspects of the motorist.They need to be coaxed into obeying the Highway Code and being exhorted to know that it is their own lives that they will cut short when they drive recklessly.Three years to the end of the United Nations Decade of Action for Road Safety, Kenya must decide that venturing on the road must not continue to be the perilous proposition it currently is.
