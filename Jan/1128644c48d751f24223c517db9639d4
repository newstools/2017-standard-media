Mombasa Senator Hassan Omar has called for an audit on the number of licensed guns in the hands of Governor Hassan Joho.Omar claimed the Mombasa governor moves around with more guns and security than even the Vice President&#39;s entourage, claims dismissed by Joho&#39;s spokesman as preposterous. The senator told journalists in Mombasa that he has proof that Joho moves around with about 30 armed men and appealed to the Central Firearms Bureau to investigate the matter.&quot;Whenever he moves, there are more than 38 armed people including police officers who move with him. He moves around with a whole police station and an armoury,&quot; said Omar.The senator argued that Joho does not require extra security because he faces no greater security threat than other elected leaders in the region.

It is unacceptable,&quot; said Omar.The senator said that he and other politicians, including ODM leader Raila Odinga and Wiper Democratic Movement leader Kalonzo Musyoka&nbsp; criticised the Jubilee government more harshly than Joho, yet they were not surrounded by armed men and a heavy security entourage.He accused Joho of orchestrating the VIP bodyguards crisis to deflect attention from corruption and poor service delivery in his county.Omar added a new twist to the saga when he called for an audit of Joho&#39;s security entourage, including guns licensed to him.Omar, a former ally of Joho who has turned bitter critic, said the governor was entitled to five security officers, including a bodyguard because he faces no greater security threat than other Kenyans.Responding to Omar&#39;s claims, Joho&#39;s spokesman Richard Chacha said they were untrue.He said until this weekend, the governor had three bodyguards who move with him and two policemen guarding his residence.

However, an audit of firearms in private hands is long overdue,&quot; said Khalid.Three Mombasa MCAs, Riziki Fundi (Bamburi), Jabez Oduor (Kongowea) and Hamisi Mwabashiri (Mjambere), also called for an audit on the number of guns in private hands in Mombasa.
