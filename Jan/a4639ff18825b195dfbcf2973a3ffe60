A Chinese contractor has appealed against an order that the Standard Gauge Railway should not cut through a national park.China Road and Bridge Corporation is challenging the ruling by the environment tribunal, which had directed that an alternative route be sought for the Sh150 billion line.Among the grounds on which CRBC is seeking to quash the decision was that Jashon K. Awuor&#39;s tribunal was improperly constituted. &quot;The order has the potential of being abused and is already being abused to frustrate the SGR phase II project by blocking the Environmental Impact Assessment study,&quot; CRBC says in its plea filed at the Environment and Land Court.Activist Okiya Omtatah and several conservationist groups sued the contractor last year, barring it from developing the line through the park, citing that it would ravage the facility and hurt wild animals.The objections attracted a sharp reaction from among others President Uhuru Kenyatta who told off the conservationists and even went ahead to launch the project, albeit outside the park in Embul Bul area in Ngong.
