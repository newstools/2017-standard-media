We now know he failed to take appropriate action to improve standards and has paid a heavy price.&quot;It&#39;s through sheer luck that no one that ate at his business suffered any health issues such as food poisoning or worse.&quot;Hopefully this will send out a serious message to other food businesses in Swansea that think it is okay to operate well below the acceptable hygiene standards.&quot;The excellent work of our council officers has ensured that consumers continue to be protected.&quot;
