More than 30 patients have died in Nakuru County since the doctors&#39; strike began more than one month ago.A spot check by The Standard revealed 14 deaths were recorded at Naivasha Sub-County Hospital since December 1, when the national strike kicked off.However, according to a source, the majority died from natural causes and their deaths were unrelated to the strike that has seen residents transfer their loved ones to private facilities. &quot;Since the doctors downed their tools, 14 patients have died in the facility and it&#39;s hard to determine which ones passed on due to the strike,&quot; said the source.The source revealed that some of the dead had terminal illness and their lives could have been prolonged if the strike had been addressed.The latest death occurred last week when a patient with multi-drug resistance tuberculosis (MDR-TB) succumbed to the condition.

She passed away as we sought an alternative,&quot; said the medic.At the Kabarnet County Hospital morgue, seven bodies were booked in the facility. Four others were preserved at the Eldama Ravine Sub-County Hospital mortuary between November and December.A nurse at Kabarnet, whose identity could not revealed due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the majority of deaths related to patients whose relatives were forced to take them back home at the start of the countrywide strike.In a related development, a fishing hook stuck in a 13-year-old boy&#39;s lip had to be removed using pliers at Kadenge Health Centre in Homa Bay, signalling the gravity of the ongoing doctors&#39; strike.The boy, a primary school pupil, was rushed to the health facility following a fishing expedition that went awry.
