A church in Kirinyaga is denying those who have not yet registered as voters the holy communion.Head of Africa Revival Christian Church in Kirinyaga Bishop Daniel Njagi shocked worshippers, who had thronged Kangaita Parish on Sunday, with his unusual announcement.&quot;We are in an election season and unless all of us arm ourselves with national identity cards and voters cards, the country will end up being ruled by leaders who are not our choice,&quot; he said. He said to ensure everyone fully exercise their democratic right, those who did not have voters&#39; cards would barred from taking the Holy Communion.The cleric demanded to first physically see the voters&#39; card from any Christian who wanted to take the Holy Communion. Most of the faithful, however, said they were shocked by the development wondering why the cleric did not notify them of the requirement the previous Sunday.&quot;I&#39;m one of those who skipped the Holy Communion since I did not carry my voter&#39;s card with me though I have already registered,&quot; said Damaris Wamutira.
