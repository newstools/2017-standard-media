The Kenya Medical Association (KMA) is ready for fresh dialogue with the Government to resolve the doctors&#39; strike.According to a communication by the National Executive Council (NEC) to members, they are exploring options to initiate talks. &ldquo;We have resolved going forward to resume talks immediately with government, calling in all the requisite parties. Goodwill is key from government side and will be displayed by stopping negative press statements and any intimidation,&rdquo; reads a communication from NEC.But the Kenya Medical Practitioners and Dentists Union (KPMDU) maintained that the strike is still on.&ldquo;KMA did not call the strike. Surprisingly, the government can spend Sh20 million to put up adverts in the media, yet even for research they only allocate Sh11 million. This money can be saved to pay doctors,&rdquo; said Ouma Oluga, the union&rsquo;s secretary general.

It is only me who can initiate such a proposal. But let it be known sourcing of foreign doctors is a though we will consider and when the time comes we will let the country know,&rdquo; said Dr Mailu.Mailu said the government is exploring every possibility to ensure Kenyans receive services.
