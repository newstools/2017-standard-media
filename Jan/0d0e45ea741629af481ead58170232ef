When Esther Muthoni started selling &#39;githeri&#39; and chapati in 1998, she did not think she would be doing this business for the next eight years.What started out as something to help her put food on the table has turned into a treasure trove for her and her family. &quot;This business has given me more than I expected. From profits made from my trade, I was able to buy land and put up my own house, I have also been able to pay fees for my four grandchildren who are now in university,&quot; she says.Located outside the Webuye Pan Paper factor, Muthoni says on a good day she sells 50 chapatis at Sh10 each and 70 cups of githeri at Sh10 each.&quot;I am assured of taking home atleast Sh1,000 everyday. This is a business that has high returns and that is why I have kept at it all these years later,&quot; she says.

She is however, optimistic that it will pick up once more since work has resumed at the factory.To survive, Muthoni gets maize, beans, wheat flour and cooking oil on credit and pays it when her customers pay her at the end of the month.&quot;I sell the food on credit, allowing the workers to pay me at the end of the month. This has been the secret to my business growth since this arrangement is one the workers are comfortable with,&quot; she says.Muthoni says before the factory collapsed, there were 10 women selling food at the place but since it was revived she is the only one doing so. This has considerably increased her customer base.
