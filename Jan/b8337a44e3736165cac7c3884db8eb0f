Seasoned politicians and new entrants are laying the groundwork for what promises to be big political contests for the elective positions in three key Rift Valley counties.Intense rivalry is already playing out in Narok, Nakuru and Bomet counties even as the clock ticks towards the August 8 polls.In Nakuru, Governor Kinuthia Mbugua and his arch-rival Lee Kinyanjui are leaving nothing to chance. Their rivalry played out at a recent meeting to mobilise and sensitise residents to register as voters in the ongoing exercise. Mr Kinyanjui took a swipe at the Mbugua administration over the water crisis in the county, which he claimed had undermined the voter registration since residents are spending more time in search of the commodity.The two do not see eye to eye ever since Kinyanjui quit his position as the chairman National Transport and Safety Authority and declared his intention to vie for the gubernatorial seat.Kinyanjui has been riding on what he terms as &lsquo;poor performance&rsquo; of the Mbugua administration, alleging corruption at the county and nepotism, which he accuses Mbugua of perpetrating.
