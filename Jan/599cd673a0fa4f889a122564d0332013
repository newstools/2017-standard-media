Trouble is simmering in Wiper Democratic Movement after two party bosses stormed out of a rally attended by party leader Kalonzo Musyoka.&nbsp;Wiper chairman and Kitui Senator David Musila and the party&rsquo;s director of elections Marcus Muluvi (Kitui East MP) drove out of a rally at Mutomo market, Kitui South, skipping two subsequent rallies in Ikutha and Mwangeni markets.Mr Musila accused Kalonzo of using the voter mobilisation drive to drum up support for Governor Julius Malombe&rsquo;s re-election bid. The two later convened a press conference in Kitui town where they criticised the former Vice President and Dr Malombe.&ldquo;It is a great disappointment for me and Kitui people for the party leader to start interfering with the will of the people on who they intend to elect as their next governor. We want to tell our party leader to leave the gubernatorial race to the electorate and concentrate on his presidential bid for his own good. We will not be persuaded whatsoever,&rdquo; the party chairman charged.Defied boss ALSO READ: Why Kalonzo wants Raila to quit big raceHe said during the two-day event in the county, Kalonzo had made it known that his preference gubernatorial candidate was Malombe.Earlier at a rally in Kisasi market, Kitui Rural constituency, Musila defied his boss, saying he would not succumb to any kind of pressure from anyone to step down in favour of anyone.&ldquo;I am not ready or prepared to listen to anybody on this matter. No persuasions will frustrate my resolve to be in the ballot for the gubernatorial seat in the next General Election,&rdquo; Musila resolved. At Ikanga market, Musila cautioned Malombe&rsquo;s supporters who tried to heckle him.&ldquo;It is unacceptable to have a few hirelings around the governor to heckle and jeer other leaders as the party leader watches indifferently. We won&rsquo;t let this continue. I am disappointed,&rdquo; he said.When things threatened to turn ugly, Kalonzo implored Malombe to ignore Musila and let the rising political temperatures die out gradually.Kalonzo said: &ldquo;I have in the past prevailed upon the senator and the governor to stick to their lines but this has not borne any fruit. I will not stop but will continue to reconcile them.&rdquo; ALSO READ: CORD wants another firm hired to audit poll register
