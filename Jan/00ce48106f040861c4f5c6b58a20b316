One of Kenya&rsquo;s untapped tourism attraction is its cultural allure. Tourism stakeholders now say the country should tap into its cultural diversities and market them to enthusiastic travellers to grow revenue.Kenya Association of Hotelkeepers and Caterers (Kahc) Coast Branch Executive Officer, Mr Sam Ikwaye said over reliance on traditional products such as beach, safari and now conference tourism is seen as offering narrow prospects for growth. &ldquo;All players agree that there is need for diversification of tourism products and services with deeper involvement of locals and communities,&rdquo; Ikwaye said.He said Kenya and especially the coastal region is experiencing changing demographics, shifting travel patterns and volatile economic conditions that are increasing the pressure on industry stakeholders to develop effective campaigns and business strategies.&nbsp;&ldquo;Therefore, communities and Kenyan cultural and heritage attractions are increasingly seen as one of the future cornerstones of tourism development. There are existing cultural and heritage attractions and the potential thereof for tourism cultural tourism in Kenya which is still underutilised in tour,&rdquo; the official said.
