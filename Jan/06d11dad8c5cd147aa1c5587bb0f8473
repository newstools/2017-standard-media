(Photo: AFP)Dakar: Gambia&#39;s President-elect Adama Barrow will be sworn in at a ceremony in the Gambian embassy in neighbouring Senegal on Thursday, diplomatic sources and party officials said.&quot;We have confirmation. It is very important to us that he will be sworn in today. Then we can make arrangements for him to go back to Gambia,&quot; Isatou Toure, a senior Barrow aide, told Reuters. The ceremony is due to take place at 1600 GMT. Barrow defeated President Yahya Jammeh in a December election but Jammeh has refused to step aside despite regional pressure to oust him if he persists in clinging on to power.
