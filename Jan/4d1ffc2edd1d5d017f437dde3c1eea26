Over 6,000 bags of maize will be distributed to famine-stricken families in West Pokot.Speaking in Kapenguria when he officially flagged off vehicles to distribute of the food, Governor Simon Kachapin said the maize will be taken to areas worst hit by the drought in the county.The governor said the county would in future buy food during harvesting season at low prices, stock it up and later distribute it during famine. &quot;We will not be biased in distributing food. People in Ombolion, Turkwel, Masol, Kamuligon and all other places will get food. Let&#39;s put our political differences aside and help save the lives of the people who elected us,&quot; said Kachapin.He said the county had invested a lot of funds in the agricultural sector to help residents produce their own food and avoid dependence on relief food.The county has also bought 200 generators to help small-scale farmers living along River Suam, Turkwel and Muruny engage in irrigation as a long-term measure to mitigate the effects of drought.

The generators will help farmers produce food that will be used at household level and the surplus sold,&quot; he said.Senator John Lonyangapuo called for more relief food.&quot;All the four sub-counties have been badly hit by hunger and Devolution Cabinet Secretary Mwangi Kiunjuri should not give people Sh2,000 to buy food. People need food, not money,&quot; he said.
