A South Korean special prosecutor&#39;s office will question Samsung Group leader Jay Y. Lee as a suspect in the widening influence-peddling scandal that led to a parliamentary vote to impeach President Park Geun-hye. Prosecutors have been looking into whether Samsung payments of about 30 billion won ($25 million) for a business and foundations backed by Park&#39;s friend, Choi Soon-sil, were connected to a 2015 decision by the national pension service to back a controversial merger of two group affiliates.Samsung has acknowledged making contributions to two foundations as well as a consulting firm controlled by Choi. The prosecution this week summoned two senior Samsung Group officials for questioning, though they were listed as witnesses.Lee Kyu-chul, a spokesman for the special prosecution team, told a briefing the Samsung leader had been summoned for questioning at 9:30 a.m. (0030 GMT) on Thursday, over suspicions including bribery, but did not elaborate.
