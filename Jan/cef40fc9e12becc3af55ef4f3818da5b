A magistrate in Mombasa Thursday released four women charged with being members of a terrorist group on a Sh500,000 bond.Resident Magistrate Henry Nyakweba questioned why the suspects were charged twice with similar charges in different courts.Maryam Said Aboud, Khadija Abdulkadir Abubakar from Malindi, Ummul Khayr Sadir Abdalla from Tanzania and Halima Adan Ali of Mombasa were charged with 19 terror charges, including being members of Al-Shabaab and conspiracy to commit terrorism in Kenya. &quot;The accused were to be convicted in one suit so that their sentence can run concurrently. All the offences they face were committed on the same day and at the same place but there are two suits,&quot; said Nyakweba.The suspects have been held since 2015 when they were first charged and denied bail.The four are also facing eight more similar charges in a separate court which they have denied.
