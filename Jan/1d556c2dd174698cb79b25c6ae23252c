Youths in Nyanza and parts of Central have stepped up peace campaigns in political violence hotspots.In Kisumu, teams of youths have formed an organisation called &#39;Eye Witness&#39; to help map out areas prone political violence. &quot;What we have discovered is that some of the youths do not access peace messages, hence find themselves in violence not because they like it,&quot; said Becky Onyancha, the organisation&#39;s leader.The youths drawn from the seven sub-counties in Kisumu are expected to form a communication network to engage their peers in churches, schools and places of work to discuss peace.They are set to recruit representatives in all villages and wards in Kisumu Central, Kisumu East, Kisumu West, Seme, Nyando, Nyakach and Muhoroni to coordinate their programs.
