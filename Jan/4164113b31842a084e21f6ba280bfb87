Two robbery with violence suspects do not want to be tried in Kakamega law courts, saying the courts take too long to conclude such cases.&nbsp; Samuel Alufunzi, alias Johnie, and Oscar Angura are accused of killing watchmen and robbing a soda depot and supermarket in Kakamega town. The duo on Thursday urged Kakamega chief magistrate Bildad Ochieng to transfer them to the neighbouring Butali law courts in Malava. &nbsp;However, their request was rejected and the case will be heard on February 27 in Kakamega. - Robert Amalemba
