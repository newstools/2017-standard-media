Deputy President William Ruto and Bungoma governor Ken Lusaka were forced take another route to Kanduyi stage skipping Bungoma town where Jubilee brigade had been scheduled to address the public at Bus Park after the town became hostile.&nbsp;The crowd started chanting songs in praise of the National Super Alliance (NASA). They vowed that DP Ruto and Lusaka will not address them saying they had swindled public funds. &nbsp;The commotion lasted for about 30 minutes but calm was later restored. The angry residents of Bungoma town vented their frustrations by burning Jubilee T-shirt. Governor Lusaka confirmed the incident saying,&rdquo; We did not get to Bungoma, we used Mateka route to Kanduyi, we were not chased.&rdquo;But in a quick rejoinder, Bungoma County Communications Director Mark Kapchanga said the leaders were not scheduled to go through Bungoma town.&ldquo;After a meeting with aspirants in Mumias, they were to address the public at Mayoni and thereafter assess progress of the Musikoma Road. The said crowd was waiting for Cord leader Raila Odinga who had planned to tour Bungoma town.&rdquo; ALSO READ: CORD plans to use Onyango Oloo 'secrets' to block Uhuru from race&ldquo;I can confirm the two leaders&#39; meetings were success based on the huge attendance in Kakamega, Bungoma and Uasin Gishu Counties.&rdquo;
