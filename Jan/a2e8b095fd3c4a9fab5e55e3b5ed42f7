Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has thrown out the Kenya Bankers Reference Rate (KBRR) introduced in 2014 as a base rate to calculate the cost of credit.The regulator&rsquo;s decision making organ &mdash; the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) &mdash; yesterday also maintained the benchmark interest rate at 10 per cent, sparing borrowers the high cost of credit.The latest development scrapping KBRR follows changes in the Banking (Amendment) Act, 2015 in August last year, which now leaves the Central Bank Rate (CBR) as the only credit pricing framework. The interest-capping law allows banks to charge only four percentage points over and above the CBR, meaning they can only charge interest on loans at a maximum of 14 per cent.AGAINST EXPECTATIONS&ldquo;The MPC considered the Kenya Bankers Reference Rate (KBRR), which was introduced to provide a transparent credit pricing framework. In view of the adoption of the new law capping interest rates, the CBK decided to suspend the KBRR framework,&rdquo;&nbsp; said CBK Governor Patrick Njoroge who chairs the MPC in a statement yesterday.

At yesterday&rsquo;s meeting, the stability of the shilling also came under sharp focus, with the committee reiterating that the country has enough fire power to manage its volatility.
