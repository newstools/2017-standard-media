Betting firms want proposed changes to the Betting, Lotteries and Gaming Act shelved. The firms claim they are likely to drive them out of business.Under the aegis of&nbsp;the Association of the Gaming Operators in Kenya (AGOK), the firms said if passed, the Betting, Lotteries and Gaming (Amendment) Bill, 2016 by Gem MP Jakoyo Midiwo would cripple the local industry while allowing foreign firms to have a grip on the unrestricted online market. They said some proposals in the bill would also make gambling illegal and infringe on Kenyans&rsquo; constitutional rights. The firms at the same time termed the proposed law punitive and impractical.&ldquo;The betting lotteries and gaming industry is an industry that is statutorily regulated, yet it appears from a flurry of uncoordinated and incoherent legislative actions that it is an illegitimate of undesirable industry,&rdquo; AGOK Chief Executive Harrison Ikunda wrote in a memorandum to the National Assembly.Mr Ikunda was referring to Treasury&rsquo;s move to increase taxes on the industry last year and a failed attempt by Mr Midiwo to convince his colleagues to form a special committee to investigate sports betting firms against suspected tax evasion and money laundering activities as well as its benefits to society and the State.

The inevitable result of such a limitation will be the violation of the constitutional protection of foreign investors.&rdquo;If the bill is passed into law, some of the leading betting firms such as SportsPesa, which are partially owned by foreign investors, would be locked out.

He also set prize competition tax chargeable on the cost of entry to a competition at 15 per cent of total gross turnover.
