A man who claimed to have information on the killers of businessman Jacob Juma has been charged with attempting to extort money from an activist.A court heard yesterday that Douglas Nyakundi attempted to extort human rights activist Boniface Mwangi in exchange for information on Mr Juma&#39;s alleged killers. He is said to have, on diverse dates between November 16 and November 24 last year, at Fatima Court in Kilimani, Nairobi, demanded an unspecified amount of money from Mr Mwangi, claiming he had vital information on the killing, a fact he knew was false.Mr Nyakundi denied the charges when he appeared before Senior Principal Magistrate Joyce Gandani yesterday.The prosecution said Nyakundi had been found fit to face trial and could therefore answer to charges after a mental check-up.The court had ordered the mental test after he made fresh claims about Juma&#39;s murder.On December 7, 2016, Nyakundi appeared in court and claimed he was coached by Mwangi on what to say on Juma&#39;s murder in a handwritten affidavit he handed to magistrate Charity Aluoch.This prompted prosecutor Duncan Ondimu to ask the court to order a mental examination for Nyakundi, who is said to have delivered a letter to Mwangi supposedly containing a confession by Juma&#39;s killers.Mwangi recorded his conversation with Nyakundi on his phone in the presence of his lawyer which subsequently led to his arrest on November 30.The accused allegedly promised he would give the activist details on who murdered Juma and even introduce him to the actual killers.He wanted Mwangi to deposit an unspecified amount of money in his account before he could give him details of an alleged plan to kill Juma through a stage-managed accident.Nyakundi was released on a Sh50,000 cash bail.The case will be mentioned on February 2.&nbsp;
