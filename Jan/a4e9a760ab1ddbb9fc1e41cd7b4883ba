KISUMU, KENYA: Jubilee officials from Nyanza have denied claims that former TNA Secretary General Onyango Oloo&#39;s defection to ODM may jeopardize Jubilee Party (JP) support in the region.Led by the party Homa Bay county interim Organizing Secretary in Charles Amenya and Vice Chairman Dancun Ogal, the officials said Jubilee support in the region has not been shaken. They argued that Oloo had defected to ODM with just a few people who cannot have negative consequences on President Uhuru Kenyatta&rsquo;s party. &quot;Oloo&#39;s defection is a decision he made for his own personal gain but he did not seek our blessings. His decision will not harm the Jubilee Party&#39;s support in Nyanza,&quot; said Amenya. Amenya argued that Oloo used to be an obstacle to TNA affairs in the region hence his exclusion from the JP is healthy for prosperity of the party.&quot;We wanted him to defect as early as three years ago because there are many activities we could not do successfully because his leadership was an obstacle to us,&quot; said Amenya. He accused Oloo of acting as an ODM spy in the Jubilee coalition. ALSO READ: Aspirant ditches Jubilee as row over party officials escalates
