More than 100 parents yesterday stormed Sergutiet Primary School in Bomet Central and evicted the head teacher over poor performance in exams.There was drama at the school for the better part of Thursday morning after the angry parents, wielding placards and twigs, forced their way into the head teacher&#39;s office and ejected him. The parents locked the office, saying they do not trust him to continue running the school because of poor results posted in last year&#39;s Kenya Certificate of Primary Education (KCPE) results.Pleas by the head teacher to explain himself over the poor performance posted under his watch fell on deaf ears.Led by Samuel Korir, the parents alleged the school&#39;s performance had continued to deteriorate since the head was posted to the school one year ago.
