A doctors&rsquo; union officials yesterday went into hiding for fear of arrest following an order issued by the courts.On Tuesday, judge Helen Wasilwa issued a warrant of arrest against seven officials of the Kenya Medical Practitioners, Pharmacists and Dentists Union (KMPDU) for refusing to appear in court for sentencing after being found guilty of disobeying a court order to end the ongoing strike. The union officials&rsquo; phones were switched off for the better part of yesterday presumably for fear of being incarcerated.Calls to the union&rsquo;s chairperson Samuel Oroko, Secretary General Frederick Oluga and Nairobi branch Secretary Thuranira Kuagiria could not go through. Other officials being sought by the police are Titus Ondoro, Allan Ochanji, Hamisi Chibanzi, Daisy Korir and Evelyne Chege.In the recent past, the striking medics have taken to the streets to address their grievances, being active on social media and getting holed up in discreet venues for meetings.

The hitherto vocal union officials went mum across all platforms, presumably to let the temperatures cool down.By the time of going to press, the last post by KMPDU on their twitter page was dated January 9, and nothing had been posted after the court order.On December 20, 2016 the judge found the officials guilty of contempt of court, as they continued with the strike despite being aware of the order that suspended the industrial action to give room to negotiations.The officials had indicated they would not obey the court order, with Justice Wasilwa saying she had issued the order on the basis that she could not condone open defiance of court by the medics.They face a jail term of up to six months or a fine to be determined by the court, or both.Meanwhile, Nairobi doctors have declined to pick their &lsquo;show-cause&rsquo; letters issued by the county government.The letters, seeking to know why the doctors should not be fired for absconding duty and participating in the strike since December last year, were signed by County Secretary Robert Ayisi.
