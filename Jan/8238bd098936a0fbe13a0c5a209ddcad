He challenged Kenyans to put up a spirited fight to remove Jubilee.He said the Opposition was ready to borrow a&nbsp; leaf from the West African country, adding that sending Uhuru home after one term was possible.In Ghana, he said, former President Mahama insisted on a manual back-up system in the elections but was still defeated by Akufo-Addo.Mahama lost the December 7 elections with over one million votes difference.Winning formula ALSO READ: Jobs and peace key focus areas in 2017Raila said Akufo-Addo had shared his winning formula after he won twice and was rigged out before finally winning by an undisputed margin.&quot;The Opposition campaign is like the mighty Nile River, flowing forcefully towards the sea. No one can divert its course,&quot; he said.Speaking at the Jomo Kenyatta grounds in Kisumu, Raila said the Opposition was not afraid of Jubilee&#39;s insistence on a manual system during the elections but warned of dire consequences against any attempts to rig the elections.He said the Opposition was closely monitoring Jubilee Party operations, claiming that their friends in the Government had already discovered tricks the ruling coalition had allegedly put in place to rig the elections.&quot;We have learnt Jubilee&#39;s election intrigues and we have put in place adequate measures to avert possible any rigging loopholes,&quot; the ODM leader said.He said the Opposition would do everything to ensure that none of the votes cast were rigged.&quot;Do not be afraid of the laws they changed.

We are watching their every step.&quot;Raila said the Opposition was countering every intended move by Jubilee to manipulate the outcome of the polls. For example, he said, the Opposition has appointed a team of 60 youths at each polling station to man the polling booths until the final results are broadcast.&quot;Rigging begins at voter registration, where the Government does not deploy enough kits in Opposition strongholds to enable more people to register as voters,&quot; said Raila.Faulty kitsHe claimed the Government had deployed several faulty BVR kits only in regions perceived to be Opposition strongholds while doing everything in their power to ensure that few people registered as voters in those areas.On the day of voting, he said, chaos was usually created in certain regions to stop people from casing their votes.&quot;The other stage is when the votes are being counted but we will ensure that our votes are not stolen this time,&quot; he said.Raila said the last stage of rigging is when the Independent Electoral and Boundaries commission (IEBC) is announcing the winner of the elections.
