A small moth with a yellowish-white coif of scales has been named after U.S. President-edit Donald Trump, in honor of the former reality TV show host and real estate magnate&#39;s signature hairdo.The new species, dubbed Neopalpa donaldtrumpi, lives in a habitat that spans southern California and Mexico&#39;s Baja California and was named by evolutionary biologist Vazrick Nazari in an article published in the scientific journal ZooKeys.The moth, the second species of a genus of twirler moths, can be distinguished by the yellowish-white scales on the head of its adults, according to the journal. &quot;The specific epithet is selected because of the resemblance of the scales on the frons (head) of the moth to Mr. Trump&#39;s hairstyle,&quot; Nazari wrote in the article, which was published on Tuesday.&quot;The reason for this choice of name is to bring wider public attention to the need to continue protecting fragile habitats in the U.S. that still contain many undescribed species,&quot; he added.News of the naming came the week Trump is set to be inaugurated as the 45th president of the United States, on Friday.
