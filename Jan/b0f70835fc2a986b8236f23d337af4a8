Preparations for the arrival of the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) locomotives at the Mombasa Port are in high gear.Kenya Ports Authority (KPA) has started modernising the Embakasi Inland Container Depot in readiness for arrival of the first batch of the locomotives ahead of the project&rsquo;s commissioning. The project&rsquo;s contractor, China Road and Bridges Corporation (CRBC), has laid out a temporary SGR rail track alongside berth 11 at the port where the ship loaded with the SGR locomotives - MV Kota Bistari - is expected to offload its cargo today.The temporary rail track will be used to shunt out the new locomotives out of the port and into kilometre zero section outside the facility where the SGR line starts.Kenya Railways Corporation is developing a new SGR line for passengers and cargo transportation between Mombasa and Nairobi.

Mr Masemo said the depo used to handle 180,000 TEUs (Twenty Equivalent Foot) units, but with the coming into operations of SGR, the figure is likely to rise to 450,000 TEUs.The rubber-tyred gantry cranes were brought in as complete knock-down components and are to be transported by road to Nairobi where engineers from Zhenua Port Machinery (ZPMC) of China will assemble and install them before they are commissioned.&quot;The cargo arrived last Friday aboard a mega vessel, MV Bulk Paraiso, and started offloading at berth number nine. We expect all cargo to be moved to Nairobi this week,&rsquo;&rsquo; said Mr Masemo.He said it will take up to four months to complete the assembling of the gantry cranes, meaning the equipment will be ready when the first trial runs for the SGR trains takes place in June .
