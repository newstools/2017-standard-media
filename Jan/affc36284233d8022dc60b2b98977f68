Coast Regional Coordinator Nelson Marwa has accused Mombasa Governor Hassan Ali Joho of faking his arrest on Friday to embarrass the Government.The outspoken Marwa yesterday accused Joho of storming Mombasa Provincial Police headquarters to seek the release of a suspect alleged to have been found with four guns the State wanted to investigate. Marwa further claimed the media fell for Joho&rsquo;s ruse and propagated false news in his favour. This, he said, sabotaged the operation. He argued that much of the coverage of this saga has been sensational, unpatriotic and insensitive to efforts to revive tourism. &ldquo;You journalists have been sensational. There are somethings you write which tarnish the country&rsquo;s image.&rdquo;
