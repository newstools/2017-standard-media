CORD co-principal Kalonzo Musyoka&#39;s Wiper Party has claimed the August polls will be rigged.The party said an incident in Wajir where Mr Kalonzo found that he shares the same National Identity Card number with another person was not by coincidence, but an orchestrated scheme to allow those with multiple IDs to vote more than once.At a Wiper National Executive Council (NEC) meeting Thursday, the party was categorical that they will not accept anything short of a free, fair, credible and transparent election. &quot;We will not condone any machinations that might lead to election rigging. It was extremely shocking that while in Wajir on Wednesday, our party leader found out that he shared an ID number with a Salome Wanjiru Njoroge who was born in 1993,&quot; said Wiper Secretary General Hassan Omar in a statement.The party also deliberated on the expanded Opposition under the banner of the National Super Alliance (NASA) and agreed to make a stand on the matter in seven days-time.NASA is being spearheaded by Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi.
