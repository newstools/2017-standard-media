At least 68 Kenyan soldiers were killed in the Friday dawn attack on their camp by Al Shabaab militants in Somalia, according to military resources.Two platoons consisting of 72 men survived after their commanders ordered that they retreat, in a possible tactical error in which the other two platoon took on the attackers, suffering massively before the camp was overrun. A company, in military terms, has four platoons, each with 36 men.Top military sources divulged in confidence details of the horror ambush, the intense gunfight that followed and the efforts by the State to conceal the scale of the damage. Thirty bodies were moved from the Moi Airbase in Eastleigh, Nairobi to the Armed Forces Memorial Hospital aboard vans bearing civilian plates, three individuals with privileged access said in separate interviews.More bodies were thought to have been received by the military throughout Friday night and Saturday morning from the destroyed Kulbiyow camp.&ldquo;It was a horrendous scene,&rdquo; one of the officers told The Standard on Sunday, adding that the attack closely mirrored last year&rsquo;s ambush at El Adde, where 173 soldiers were killed.

It has since emerged that the statement was sent when more than a dozen bodies had been received at Moi Airbase.Our sources, who could not be named because military protocol does not allow them to speak to the media, said KDF took over the camp last night after two platoons overpowered the militants with backup from air and land forces called in from Kenya.At least 70 Al Shabaab militants were reported to have been killed in the fierce fighting before the camp was recaptured by KDF.

Tens of militants on pick-up trucks fitted with heavy artillery, stormed in and opened fire on the soldiers.Unlike in the El Adde ambush, two commanders ordered their troops to retreat and take cover before making a formation to take on the enemy. It is military tradition to stick to your platoon and take instructions only from your commander.This is how men who may have been together were separated, and possibly the difference between life and death. Details of how far the platoons that retreated made it still remain scanty, but the commanders were in constant communication with their seniors in Kenya who sent through the back-up forces.After the special forces arrived, the officers returned to the camp, which had by then been overrun and burnt.There are also unconfirmed claims that the militants escaped with vehicles and arms confiscated from the camp before the backup arrived. Generally, the militants replenish their food and arms stocks when staging such attacks. ALSO READ: Kenya lost 173 soldiers in terror attack on KDF base in Somalia, survivor says
