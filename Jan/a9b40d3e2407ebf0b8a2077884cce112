Trans Nzoia Governor Patrick Khaemba has refuted reports that he has defected to Amani National Congress (ANC).Mr Khaemba said he was in Ford Kenya to stay and pledged to continue working harmoniously with the party leadership.Speculation has been rife that the governor had ditched Ford Kenya after he attended a meeting at the residence of ANC deputy leader Kipruto Kirwa in Cherangany last week. But Khaemba said he had been invited as a member of the National Super Alliance. He was speaking at the County Referral Hospital on Saturday during a tour to assess the progress of a multi-million-shilling building at the facility.
