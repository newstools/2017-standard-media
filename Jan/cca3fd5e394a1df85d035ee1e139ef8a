Former Criminal Investigation Director (CID) Noah Arap Too&#39;s daughter has joined the race for the Ainamoi parliamentary seat.Ms Anne Too, the first born daughter of former long serving Criminal Investigations Department Director the late Noah Arap Too who also served for one term as the Ainamoi MP in the 2003 general election, said she aims to continue with her father&#39;s development and political legacy.&quot;My father was a pragmatic and astute politician and I want to continue his legacy by following on his footsteps. Ainamoi constituency is an area of contracts since while tea grows in some areas, in others it is maize and some parts is semi-arid area with no cash crops. I have thought out and come out with solutions to address most of the crucial issues affecting the residents in the areas,&quot; said Ms Too. Speaking at Kenegut village after receiving the family blessing to gun for the political seat, the psychology and criminology graduate said if elected as the Ainamoi MP, her first priority would be turn the semi-arid areas in the constituency into a productivity as well as provide clean water sources to the area womenfolk.&quot;If elected to the Ainamoi&#39;s first female and the Kericho county elected female member of parliament, I will not allow anymore for women to spend many hours which they should be using for economic activities to go to the rivers to fetch water,&quot; said Ms Too.She added that she would also ensure that more heath centres are constructed in Ainamoi and therefore reduce the distance ailing residents are forced to travel to seek medical treatment.Ms Too, therefore called on eligible but unregistered voters to come out in their numbers to register as voters in preparation of supporting her in the August polls.According to the South rift regional IEBC coordinator Mr Stephen Ngeno, there are 31,629 unregistered voters in Ainamoi constituency, Bureti has 29,668, Belgut (27,805), Kipkelion East (20,396), Soin/ Sigowet (17,903) and 17, 055 in Kipkelion West constituency.During his voter registration campaign in the county on Friday, Deputy president William Ruto expressed alarm over the low 5,000 individuals who have turned up to register themselves as voters.The worrying situation has forced Belgut constituency political aspirant Mr Nelson Koech to hire a voter registration campaign truck to go around the constituency to fight against the voter apathy.&quot;Though the three day voter campaign registration drive costs me an average of Sh300, 000 a day, I don&#39;t mind it because it is for a noble mission. Every Kenyan must be reminded what is its very important to register as a voter because his or her life depends on it,&quot; said Koech.
