Kenya marks the first anniversary of an attack on a military camp in Somalia on Sunday.Nearly 150 soldiers from the Eldoret-based 9th Kenya Riffles Battalion died in the dawn ambush by Al Shabaab fighters who also reportedly took hostages in El Adde. Different accounts place the number of captives at a dozen including 40-year old Leonard Maingi Kiiyo who was paraded by the militants in a propaganda video released last September.In the video, Maingi pleads with President Uhuru Kenyatta to intercede by opening negotiations with the terror group, and possibly pay ransom to grant their release.&quot;Mr President, this may be the last chance to plead with you as my commander that I swore to serve and one that I love. Please, I&#39;m begging you Mr President,&quot; Mr Maingi pleads in the video.
