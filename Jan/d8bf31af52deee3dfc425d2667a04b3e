Parents from different parts of the country are outraged by new methods employed by heads of public primary and secondary schools to fleece them.At Moi Primary School in Thika town, which is a public school, learning was paralysed when parents held a peaceful demonstration to protest against extra charges they termed illegal. They showed fee structures where the school had introduced a fee of Sh45,000 for new parents. According to the structure, new parents are required to pay Sh24,000 admission fee, Sh10,000 building fund, Sh3,500 fees, Sh2,300 for computer and Sh4,490 for feeding.The Education Cabinet Secretary had warned action would be taken against school heads flouting fees guidelines issued by the ministry. The angry parents also took issue with Sh4,000 contribution per parent to construct a toilet and Sh500 annual subscription fee.

The school feeding programme has also been stopped until further notice and the school should also refund all the illegal monies they had collected,&quot; said Mr Koigi.The head teacher of the school, Mr William Kamau, declined to speak to the media.The story is the same in Eldoret where parents have expressed concern over the huge burden that awaits them as Form One selection process concludes.Their concern is mainly pegged on outrageous purchase of mattresses, buckets, slashers, pangas, hockey sticks, among other items, based on the schools&#39; reporting checklist.

The other supplier will get another cheque of Sh6,500 so that my son is issued with a mattress, bedsheet and a bucket,&quot; said the concerned parent .Parents have also raised concern over some schools rejecting second-hand textbooks and ordering them to buy new ones from select book shops.A second-hand textbook vendor in the town, Mr Mike Njenga, said the move had drastically reduced the number of customers who normally flock his shop during opening days.&quot;Most schools are currently giving specifications on new textbooks and rejecting the second-hand books, which are way cheaper than buying a new book. Only a few schools are currently accepting second-hand textbooks,&quot; Njenga said.Another parent whose daughter is to join Nginda Girls in the same county produced an admission letter with specific demands.&quot;The school uniform can be obtained from Gloliza General Supplies at a cost of Sh10,240 and be deposited to Gloliza General Supplies, Account number.....

The ministry should also provide a circular on the same so that parents cannot be oppressed,&quot; he added.Among those who want Matiang&#39;i to intervene in the matter are Nakuru Town East MP David Gikaria who has called on the Education CS to take stern measures against school heads charging high fees.&quot;The Ministry of Education should monitor closely what schools are charging and take action against school heads who raise fees,&quot; said Gikaria.In Nakuru, parents of school-going children have raised concern over schools&#39; alleged &#39;collusion&#39; with uniform shops to hike the prices.Some parents said they had received notes from schools directing them which shops to buy the uniform for their children.
