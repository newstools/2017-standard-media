Narc Kenya leader Martha Karua has called for dialogue to resolve the impasse pitting the Opposition and the government over electoral laws ahead of August&rsquo;s General Election. Ms Karua said the disagreement on whether to use manual or digital system in election results transmission did not bode well for the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She said leaders must avoid situations that could cause conflict. Speaking after opening a Narc Kenya office in Runyenjes town, Embu County yesterday, Karua reminded MPs allied to Jubilee to note that their colleagues in the Opposition are Kenyans too and their views should be considered. The Narc Kenya said it was not too late for leaders to amend the contentious issues in the law.
