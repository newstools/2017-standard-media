The crowning of Amani National Congress (ANC) leader Musalia Mudavadi as the Luhya spokesperson is proving just an another futile attempt to unite the community.Politicians allied to Ford Kenya leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula are plotting a move to counter Mudavadi&#39;s new role and influence. A Luhya elders&#39; forum headed by Patrick Wangati, who is a Ford Kenya Nominated MP, has convened a meeting to deliberate on Mudavadi&#39;s elevated status, which Wangati says could split the people further instead of uniting them.The forum convenes on January 13 to discuss the matter and possibly give a political direction that many commentators say could complicate things.Already, Wetang&#39;ula, Kakamega Senator Boni Khalwale, Bungoma Governor Kenneth Lusaka, several legislators and some Luhya elders have chided the naming of Mudavadi as the region&#39;s pointman.

Governor Lusaka refused to be dragged into the matter &quot;as my focus is on popularising Jubilee Party in Western towards 2017 elections&quot;.Mumias East MP Benjamin Washiali, also a JP supporter, said Mudavadi would only get their support if he shelved his presidential ambition in support of President Uhuru Kenyatta&#39;s second bid.&quot;I have no problem so long as Mudavadi&#39;s name will not be on the ballot because we must guide our people in the right direction,&quot; Washiali said.A local political activist, Martin Andati, is of the view that Atwoli rushed things when he should have created room for thorough consultations. He said a decision to give Mudavadi the community spokesperson mantle could backfire in the long run.
