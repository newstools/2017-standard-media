Corruption claims have rocked Parliament after a senator sensationally linked a commission to a possible Sh2 billion scam.Speaker of the National Assembly Justin Muturi, who chairs the Parliamentary Service Commission (PSC), was forced to issue a statement denying claims by Nyamira Senator Mong&rsquo;are Okong&rsquo;o linking PSC to a scheme to vary the cost of constructing a 26-storey building meant for MPs&rsquo; offices by Sh1 billion.Mr Okong&rsquo;o additionally claimed PSC was planning to buy land worth another Sh1 billion from one of the commissioners in what he said was a clear case of conflict of interest. He said Senate Clerk Jeremiah Nyegenye had refused to approve the additional amount for the skyscraper, putting him at loggerheads with key PSC commissioners pushing for the inflation.As a result, the senator claimed, a plot has been hatched to weaken Mr Nyegenye&rsquo;s office as punishment for refusing to play ball.&ldquo;This greed, which is part of the looting that is about to be perpetrated when the country is least watching because of the confusion that PSC has been pushing the Speaker of the Senate to approve the variation but he has refused... The PSC has now hatched a plot to dilute the office of Clerk of the Senate, who is the accounting officer of Parliament through an amendment to the law,&rdquo; he said.
