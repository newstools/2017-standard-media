Scientists have found that the brain cells in mice that stimulate the urge to eat can be activated by alcohol as well as by hunger - a discovery that could help explain why binge drinking often leads to binge eating.In an experiment, mice subjected to a three-day &quot;alcoholic weekend&quot; were found to eat significantly more food than mice that stayed sober. The results, published in the journal Nature Communications on Tuesday, show that major components of the brain&#39;s feeding circuits are activated by alcohol, the researchers said.&quot;Our data suggest that alcohol sustains fundamental appetite signals, (and does) not just disinhibit their behavioral manifestation,&quot; wrote Denis Burdakov, who led the study at the Francis Crick Institute in London.Consumption of alcohol has previously been linked to overeating in humans, but the underlying causes were unclear - particularly since alcohol is high in calories, and calorie intake usually suppresses brain appetite signals.

Public Health England said last month that eight out of 10 middle-aged adults in Britain either weigh too much, drink too much or exercise too little.
