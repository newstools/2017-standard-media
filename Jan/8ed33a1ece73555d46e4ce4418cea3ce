The launch of 525 police vehicles by President Uhuru Kenyatta on Monday this week is in keeping with the Government&rsquo;s pledge to step up security. Terrorist attacks on the country in 2014 and regular raids by cattle rustlers in parts of the country and the lack, or poor security personnel response betrayed security shortcomings that needed to be addressed sooner than later.Earlier positive measures included the setting up of a police forensic lab and the Sh15 billion partnership with Safaricom to set up surveillance cameras across major cities. The number of policemen in active service has risen to 99,000 officers, surpassing the Government&rsquo;s target of 1 officer for every 535 as promised by President Kenyatta in his 2013 State of the Nation address. But while the President assured Kenyans security will be improved with the latest acquisitions, there are concerns, especially in this election year and at a time when the Government and the Opposition are not seeing eye to eye, that an element of intimidation in perceived Opposition areas could arise. This need not be the case if the August 2017 elections are to be considered be free and fair.It is incumbent upon our security services to use the police armoured personnel carriers and vehicles in securing our borders, towns and streets against terrorists and common criminals. Quite often the police have failed to react to emergencies, citing lack of vehicles.There have been incidents where the police have even demanded for fuel from complainants before visiting crime scenes. The motorised units section must therefore ensure the vehicles not only have enough fuel whenever they are needed, they must be regularly serviced to avoid grounding them; a common enough practice. The police have the chance to clean their soiled image. They should take it. ALSO READ: Boost for police as Uhuru flags off 500 new assorted vehicles
