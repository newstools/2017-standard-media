Disgruntled Jubilee Party aspirants in Meru now want President Uhuru Kenyatta to intervene over the composition of interim branch officials.Speaking at a meeting which culminated into a memorandum to be sent to the President, the aspirants said they had little faith in the ability of the interim office to deliver credible party primaries. &ldquo;There is a political formation in Meru called Kikali that has been erroneously equated to JP,&rdquo; said the group in a statement read by governor aspirant Kilemi Mwiria.Kikali is an acronym of a line up comprising Senator Kiraitu Murungi, Woman Representative Florence Kajuju and Igembe South MP Mithika Linturi.The aspirants blamed the lineup of placing the party branch in a tight control. They claimed that many aspirants had stopped eyeing the JP ticket while two senatorial aspirants -- GG Thuranira and Maranya Kobia -- had been threatened into to dropping out in favour of Linturi.
