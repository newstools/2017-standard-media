The British Antarctic Society is recalling scientists from its Halley VI polar research base in March after a fissure developed in the ice sheet.The decision was taken after a huge crack appeared in the Brunt Ice Shelf, just 10 miles away from the Halley VI research station. &quot;We want to do the right thing for our people,&rdquo; said Captain Tim Stocking, Director of Operations at the British Antarctic Society (BAS).&quot;Bringing them home for winter is a prudent precaution given the changes that our glaciologists have seen in the ice shelf in recent months.&quot;There are currently 88 scientists stationed at the Halley VI research centre, which monitors climate data and played a key role in discovering the ozone hole in 1986.The station is currently undergoing a process of relocation, after a fissure - once thought to be dormant &ndash; began encroaching on the base in 2012, advancing a mile every year.But the new site is faced with another huge chasm, which developed in October 2016.Scientists from the center have been monitoring the chasm&rsquo;s development but cannot be sure whether a large iceberg will &quot;calve,&rsquo; splitting away from the main ice shelf.According to the BAS, the risk of this happening is low and the decision to pull scientists form the research station was made as a precautionary measure.If the ice fractured during summer months, an evacuation could be swiftly mounted. But the forthcoming Antarctic winter complicates things, bringing 24-hour darkness and frozen seas, making evacuation an extremely complex processScientists will return to their duties at the research center once winter has passed.
