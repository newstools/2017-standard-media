Kenya and the United Nations have agreed to reset their fractured relations caused by a dispute over military deployment in South Sudan.The thawing of relationship emerged during a bilateral meeting between President Uhuru Kenyatta and new UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres in the Ethiopian capital Addis Ababa.The meeting, the first in a series of meetings between the UN chief and African leaders, focused on peacekeeping, peace and security, with focus on Kenya&#39;s role, as well as events in South Sudan, Sudan, Somalia and Burundi. &quot;I want the United Nations to be reconciled with Kenya. Let us make a fresh start. Kenya is a very important player in the region and I feel that we have to work together to secure peace and security. Let us put the past behind us,&quot; Guterres told President Kenyatta.&quot;We want to move forward. We have full confidence in Kenya&#39;s military. As a sign of our confidence in the Kenya Defence Forces, and in the Kenyan government, the UN would like to offer Kenya the Darfur command,&quot; Guterres added.President Kenyatta said he agreed to a reset in the relations, and would look forward to senior officials from both sides meeting in Addis Ababa to work out details of the new arrangements.
