Kenyans will have to dig deeper into their pockets for basic goods this year as the country enters the worst drought in half a decade.This comes even as the Kenyan shilling continues to weaken against the US dollar, raising the country&#39;s import bill and further pushing up inflationary pressures. The National Drought Management Authority (NDMA) is now warning that depressed short rains across all counties in December will lead to a drought situation last experienced in 2011.The authority further said rainfall levels in December were too low to reverse the dry spell. Counties in arid and semi-arid lands (Asals) will bear the brunt of the drought.&quot;In almost all counties, the vegetation condition was worse in December than it was in November,&quot; said the authority in a report titled National Drought Early Warning Bulletin.

Other counties such as Isiolo, Garissa, Tana River, Wajir and Tharaka Nithi recorded similar dire conditions.The VCI is a reading of the state of vegetation cover that compares it with the range of values for the same period in previous years classifying regions under five broad categories - above-normal vegetation, normal vegetation, moderate vegetation deficit, severe vegetation deficit, and extreme vegetation deficit.The counties named all have VCI values dipping into the negative, indicating extreme vegetation deficit for the last three months. The situation is expected to worsen in the coming months.&quot;For the most part, pans and dams recharged to far less than their maximum capacity,&quot; read the NDMA report in part.OPEN SOURCES&quot;High surface temperatures reported in counties such as Baringo and Taita Taveta mean any remaining open sources will dry up sooner than usual. River levels in Isiolo, Meru and West Pokot had already reduced significantly by the end of December.&quot;This, coupled with the pressure currently being experienced by the Kenyan shilling, is expected to drive up the cost of basic commodities thereby bursting the budgets of many households.
