Uasu Chairman Muga K&#39;olale said:&quot;The university staff feel most oppressed, most disregarded and most exploited,&quot; he said. They want the least paid lecturer to pocket Sh350,000 and professors Sh1.9 million a month.&nbsp;But their employer, told the judge that the strike is illegal and unprotected. Although they had opted to call off the strike, Justice Wasilwa ordered that status quo should be maintained. The Kenya Union of Domestic Hotels, Education Health Institutions and Allied workers (KUDHEHIA) were also ordered not to strike up until negotiations are over. The hearing for the lecturers&#39; case is on January 18 whereas the KUDHEIHA will be mentioned on February 14.
