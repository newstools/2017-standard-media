Opposition leader Raila Odinga has claimed the Jubilee administration plans to use billions of stolen cash to manipulate the next elections.Raila said the ruling coalition, since taking power in 2013, had been creating &#39;tiny billionaires&#39; at the expense of suffering Kenyans to help them retain power in the forthcoming election. He said top Government officials responsible for siphoning public funds are enjoying the patronage of the presidency in complete disregard of the long-term interests of the nation.He accused the Government of crippling the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) by appointing a user-friendly top brass to disable any investigation and the prosecution of suspected individuals.&quot;That is how it got to clear the National Youth Service and the Eurobond transaction, and flatly refused to investigate the &quot;Chickengate&quot; bribery scandal at the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission and the Kenya National Examination Council (Knec),&quot; Raila said.

Instead, the internal auditor who unearthed the theft was transferred and demoted. Proceeds from the Eurobond disappeared without a trace yet Jubilee has furiously claimed the money was well spent.&quot;Raila said for the survival of the nation, Kenyans should vote out Jubilee to give room for a clean, competent, caring, accountable, inclusive and honest government.&quot;We must stand up against the billionaires&#39; club. This conspiracy has produced a tiny billionaire class in just four years whose members contribute millions at weekly harambees while the rest of the population struggles to get basic resources,&quot; said Raila.The ODM leader sounded alarm that the Jubilee administration plans to use the alleged stolen money to corrupt the electoral process; &quot;They will buy support and steal elections, thereby creating a vicious cycle of a corrupt regime, stolen elections and another corrupt regime.&quot;In his New Year message to the country, Raila praised the transformation in the education sector spearheaded by Cabinet Secretary Fred Matiang&#39;i, saying it was the only notable difference that stands out for the Jubilee administration.He dismissed the Government&#39;s acclaimed investments in various projects, among them the last mile power connectivity saying Jubilee has brought more harm than good that has harshly affected businesses.He said Jubilee is to blame for the thousands who are jobless courtesy of mega companies closing shop among them Softa, Coca Cola (which downgraded its offices but opened more in other countries), and Sameer Africa.
