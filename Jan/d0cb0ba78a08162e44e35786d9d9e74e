Parliament has approved all the seven nominees to the electoral commission despite questions on the skills and experience.A section of the Justice and Legal Affairs Committee accused the selection panel of doing a shoddy job even as MPs voted to approve the nominees to the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC). Sources within the committee told The Standard there were questions on whether the interviewing panel conducted background checks on the nominees before forwarding their names to President Uhuru Kenyatta.The committee noted that other than Dr Roselyne&nbsp;Akombe, a political officer at the United Nations and Dr Paul Kurgat, a senior lecturer at Moi University, none of the other candidates has the necessary experience on electoral matters, a key requirement for one of the country&#39;s most important jobs. &quot;There was a feeling by some members the selection panel did not do a lot of background check on the nominees. However, our work was not to check on whether the candidates met the conditions set out in the advertisements. That work should have been done by the panel,&quot; said a committee member who spoke to the Standard in confidence.
