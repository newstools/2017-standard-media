Governor Patrick Khaemba has been kicked out of Ford Kenya for allegedly disrespecting party leader Moses Wetang&#39;ula.Party officials labelled the governor a &#39;rebel&#39; following claims that he refused to answer phone calls from Mr Wetang&#39;ula.During a meeting held in Kitale, the officials resolved to kick the governor out, saying he had shown no commitment to party affairs and had disrespected the party leader. &quot;We have given up on him. We thought he would change but it has finally dawned on us that he can&#39;t change. We don&#39;t want him in our party anymore,&quot; said Kiminini Ford Kenya organising secretary James Wanambisi.The party&#39;s Trans Nzoia secretary, Martin Waliaula, said they would now focus on recruiting a new candidate out of five to fill the gap left by Mr Khaemba.&quot;We have enough options because there are able candidates within our party who are willing to raise our flag in the search for a new governor for Trans Nzoia County,&quot; he said.
