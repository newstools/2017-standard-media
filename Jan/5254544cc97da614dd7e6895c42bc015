Police officers have been directed to stop guarding politicians who attend public gatherings accompanied by armed goons.Homa Bay County Commissioner Kassim Farrah issued the order yesterday, citing cases where politicians request for police security during public functions only to turn up with armed goons in the same function. Mr Farrah argued that it is wrong for police officers to be offering a politician security alongside armed goons.He said any police officer who violates the directive will suffer punitive measures. &quot;Any police officer found in violation of this order will be punished by use of force standing orders,&quot; said Farrah. Farrah said the presence of police in political gatherings alongside armed goons painted a bad picture of the uniformed officers by implying that they were supporting hooliganism.
